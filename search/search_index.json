An API is an application programming interface - in short, it\u2019s a set of rules that lets programs talk to each other, exposing data and functionality across the internet in a consistent format. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. This is an architectural pattern that describes how distributed systems can expose a consistent interface. When people use the term \u2018REST API,\u2019 they are generally referring to an API accessed via HTTP protocol at a predefined set of URLs. These URLs represent various resources - any information or content accessed at that location, which can be returned as JSON, HTML, audio files, or images. Often, resources have one or more methods that can be performed on them over HTTP, like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Authentication ~ An API Key can be generated from the User Settings page ( [Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Users ). This is stored as a 128-bit bytes object in the database, but will be presented to the user as a base64-encoded string. This can be used to access HTTPS endpoints. Mycodo supports several authentication methods. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will fail. Bash Examples ~ curl can be used, but you must either use -k to allow the use of an unsigned SSL certificate, or use your own certificate and domain. curl -k -v -X GET \"https://127.0.0.1/api/settings/users\" -H \"authorization: Basic 0scjVcxRGi0XczregANBRXG3VMMro+oolPYdauadLblaNThd79bzFPITJjYneU1yK/Ikc9ahHXmll9JiKZO9+hogKoIp2Q8a2cMFBGevgJSd5jYVYz5D83dFE5+OBvvKKaN1U5TvPOXXcj3lkjvPzgxOnEF0CZUsKfU3MA3cFEs=\" -H \"accept: application/vnd.mycodo.v1+json\" curl -k -v -x GET \"https://127.0.0.1/api/settings/users -H \" X-API-KEY: 0scjVcxRGi0XczregANBRXG3VMMro+oolPYdauadLblaNThd79bzFPITJjYneU1yK/Ikc9ahHXmll9JiKZO9+hogKoIp2Q8a2cMFBGevgJSd5jYVYz5D83dFE5+OBvvKKaN1U5TvPOXXcj3lkjvPzgxOnEF0CZUsKfU3MA3cFEs = \" -H \" accept: application/vnd.mycodo.v1+json \" curl -k -v -x GET \"https://127.0.0.1/api/settings/users?api_key=0scjVcxRGi0XczregANBRXG3VMMro+oolPYdauadLblaNThd79bzFPITJjYneU1yK/Ikc9ahHXmll9JiKZO9+hogKoIp2Q8a2cMFBGevgJSd5jYVYz5D83dFE5+OBvvKKaN1U5TvPOXXcj3lkjvPzgxOnEF0CZUsKfU3MA3cFEs=\" -H \"accept: application/vnd.mycodo.v1+json\" Python Example (GET) ~ import json import requests ip_address = '127.0.0.1' api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY' endpoint = 'settings/inputs' url = 'https:// {ip} /api/ {ep} ' . format ( ip = ip_address , ep = endpoint ) headers = { 'Accept' : 'application/vnd.mycodo.v1+json' , 'X-API-KEY' : api_key } response = requests . get ( url , headers = headers , verify = False ) print ( \"Response Status: {} \" . format ( response . status_code )) print ( \"Response Headers: {} \" . format ( response . headers )) response_dict = json . loads ( response . text ) print ( \"Response Dictionary: {} \" . format ( response_dict )) Python Example (POST) ~ import json import requests import urllib3 urllib3 . disable_warnings ( urllib3 . exceptions .

In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Mycodo's servers (these are rare). Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is declined) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported. Endpoints ~ A vendor-specific content type header must be included to determine which API version to use. For version 1, this is \"application/vnd.mycodo.v1+json\", as can be seen in the examples, above.

Originally developed for cultivating edible mushrooms, Mycodo has grown to do much more. The system consists of two parts: a backend (daemon) and a frontend (web server). The backend performs tasks such as acquiring measurements from sensors and devices and coordinating a diverse set of responses to those measurements, including the ability to modulate outputs (switch relays, generate PWM signals, operate pumps, switch wireless outlets, publish/subscribe to MQTT, among others), regulate environmental conditions with PID control, schedule timers, capture photos and stream video, trigger actions when measurements meet certain conditions, and more. The frontend hosts a web interface that enables viewing and configuration from any browser-enabled device. There are a number of different uses for Mycodo. Some users simply store sensor measurements to monitor conditions remotely, others regulate the environmental conditions of a physical space, while others capture motion-activated or time-lapse photography, among other uses. Input controllers acquire measurements and store them in the InfluxDB time series database . Measurements typically come from sensors, but may also be configured to use the return value of linux or Python commands, or math equations, making a very powerful system for acquiring and generating data. Output controllers produce changes to the general input/output (GPIO) pins or may be configured to execute linux or Python commands, enabling a large number of potential uses. There are a few different types of outputs: simple switching of GPIO pins (HIGH/LOW), generating pulse-width modulated (PWM) signals, switching 315/433 MHz wireless outlets, controlling Atlas Scientific peristaltic pumps, as well as executing linux and Python commands. The most common output is using a relay to switch electrical devices on and off. When Inputs and Outputs are combined, PID controllers may be used to create a feedback loop that uses the Output device to modulate an environmental condition the Input measures. Certain Inputs may be coupled with certain Outputs to create a variety of different control and regulation applications. Beyond simple regulation, Methods may be used to create a changing setpoint over time, enabling such things as thermal cyclers, reflow ovens, environmental simulation for terrariums, food and beverage fermentation or curing, and cooking food ( sous-vide ), to name a few. Triggers can be set to activate events based on specific dates and times, according to durations of time, or the sunrise/sunset at a specific latitude and longitude. Conditionals are used to activates certain events based on the truth of custom user conditional statements (e.g. \"Sensor1 > 23 and 10 < Sensor2 < 30\").

Live Measurements ~ Page: Data -> Live Measurements The Live Measurements page is the first page a user sees after logging in to Mycodo. It will display the current measurements being acquired from Input and Function controllers. If there is nothing displayed on the Live page, ensure an Input or Function controller is both configured correctly and activated. Data will be automatically updated on the page from the measurement database. Asynchronous Graphs ~ Page: Data -> Asynchronous Graphs A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Synchronous Graph. Select a time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists. The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700 data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4 months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded. However, when viewing a 4 month span, it's not possible to see every data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only ~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which time only another ~50kb is downloaded. Note Graphs require measurements, therefore at least one Input/Output/Function/etc. needs to be added and activated in order to display data. Dashboard ~ Page: Data -> Dashboard The dashboard can be used for both viewing data and manipulating the system, thanks to the numerous dashboard widgets available. Widgets are how data is presented to the user and how the user can control aspects of the system from the dashboard. These include graphs, gauges, indicators, and more. For a full list of supported Widgets, see Supported Widgets . Multiple dashboards can be created. Widgets can be moved and arranged on the dashboards by dragging and can be resized by pulling the bottom-left or bottom-right side of the widget. Custom Widgets ~ There is a Custom Widget import system in Mycodo that allows user-created Widgets to be used in the Mycodo system. Custom Widgets can be uploaded on the [Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Custom Widgets page. After import, they will be available to use on the Setup -> Widget page. If you develop a working Widget module, please consider creating a new GitHub issue or pull request, and it may be included in the built-in set. Open any of the built-in modules located in the directory Mycodo/mycodo/widgets for examples of the proper formatting. There are also example Custom Widgets in the directory Mycodo/mycodo/widgets/examples Additionally, I have another github repository devoted to Custom Modules that are not included in the built-in set, at kizniche/Mycodo-custom . Graph Widget ~ A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning relatively short periods of time (hours/days/weeks). Select a time frame to view data and continually updating data from new sensor measurements. Multiple graphs can be created on one page that enables a dashboard to be created of graphed sensor data. Each graph may have one or more data from inputs, outputs, or PIDs rendered onto it. To edit graph options, select the plus sign on the top-right of a graph. Setting Description x-Axis (minutes) The duration to display on the x-axis of the graph. Enable Auto Refresh Automatically refresh the data on the graph Refresh Period.

Enable Navbar Show a slidable navigation bar at the bottom of the graph. Enable Export Enable a button on the top right of the graph to allow exporting of the currently-displayed data as PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, CSV, XLS. Enable Range Selector Show a set of navigation buttons at the top of the graph to quickly change the display duration. Enable Custom Colors Use custom colors for Input, Output, and PID lines. Select the colors with the buttons that appear below this checkbox. Enable Manual Y-Axis Min/Max Set the minimum and maximum y-axes of a particular graph. Set both the minimum and maximum to 0 to disable for a particular y-axis. Enable Y-Axis Align Ticks Align the ticks of several y-axes of the same graph. Enable Y-Axis Start On Tick Start all y-axes of a graph on the same tick. Enable Y-Axis End On Tick End all y-axes of a graph on the same tick.

If there are more than 700 data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4 months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded. However, when viewing a 4 month span, it's not possible to see every data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only ~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which time only another ~50kb is downloaded.

Edge Detection ~ The detection of a changing signal, for instance a simple switch completing a circuit, requires the use of edge detection. By detecting a rising edge (LOW to HIGH), a falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both, actions or events can be triggered. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal should be equipped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the GPIO up [to 5-volts] or down [to ground]. The option to enable the internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low. Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect sensors, float switches, and more. LCD Displays ~ There are only a few number fo LCDs that are supported. 16x2 and 20x4 character LCD displays with I2C backpacks and the 128x32 / 128x64 OLED displays are supported. The below image is the type of device with the I2C backpack that should be compatible. Raspberry Pi ~ The Raspberry Pi has an integrated temperature sensor on the BCM2835 SoC that measure the temperature of the CPU/GPU. This is the easiest sensor to set up in Mycodo, as it is immediately available to be used. AM2315 ~ From @Theoi-Meteoroi on GitHub: I figured out why this [AM2315] sensor is unreliable with Rpi3 hardware I2C. It is among a number of I2C devices that really hates the BCM2835 clock stretching blunder (hardware bug: raspberrypi/linux#254 ). The wakeup attempts fail, consistently. I checked the bitstream with a sniffer, and see that the sensor may respond once out of 20 or so tries (or not at all) but only with a single byte returned. The solution is to use a software implementation of the I2C bus. You need to add pull-up resistors (4.7k is dandy) to 3.3v and install the i2c_gpio device overlay. Seems to work fine now, will run for a few days, but the CRC failures are gone and I get good readings, every time. And no twiddling the power for the sensor is required. To enable software I2C, add the following line to your /boot/config.txt dtoverlay=i2c-gpio,i2c_gpio_sda=23,i2c_gpio_scl=24,i2c_gpio_delay_us=4 After rebooting, a new I2C bus at /dev/i2c-3 should exist with SDA on pin 23 (BCM) and SCL on pin 24 (BCM). Make sure you add the appropriate pull-up resistors before connecting any devices. K-30 ~ Be very careful when connecting the K-30, as there is no reverse-voltage protection and improper connections could destroy your sensor. Wiring instructions for the Raspberry Pi can be found here . USB Device Persistence Across Reboots ~ From (#547) Theoi-Meteoroi on Github : Using USB devices, such as USB-to-serial interfaces (CP210x) to connect a sensor, while convenient, poses an issue if there are multiple devices when the system reboots. After a reboot, there is no guarantee the device will persist with the same name. For instance, if Sensor A is /dev/ttyUSB0 and Sensor B is /dev/ttyUSB1, after a reboot Sensor A may be /dev/ttyUSB1 and Sensor B may be /dev/ttyUSB0. This will cause Mycodo to query the wrong device for a measurement, potentially causing a mis-measurement, or worse, an incorrect measurement because the response is not from the correct sensor (I've seen my temperature sensor read 700+ degrees celsius because of this!). Follow the instructions below to alleviate this issue. I use udev to create a persistent device name ('/dev/dust-sensor') that will be linked to the /dev/ttyUSBn that is chosen at device arrival in the kernel. The only requirement is some attribute returned from the USB device that is unique. The common circumstance is that none of the attributes are unique and you get stuck with just VID and PID, which is ok as long as you don't have any other adapters that report the same VID and PID. If you have multiple adapters with the same VID and PID, then hopefully they have some unique attribute. This command will walk the attributes. Run on each USB device and then compare differences to possibly find some attribute to use. udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk I ended up using the serial number on the ZH03B to program the USB adapter serial field. This way guarantees unique serial numbers rather than me trying to remember what was the last serial number I used to increment by 1. When you plug a USB device in it can be enumerated to different device names by the operating system. To fix this problem for this sensor on linux, I changed attributes that make the connection unique.

The first relies on determining how long Outputs have been on. Based on this, if the number of Amps the output draws has been set in the output Settings, then the kWh and cost can be calculated. Discovering the number of amps the device draws can be accomplished by calculating this from the output typically given as watts on the device label, or with the use of a current clamp while the device is operating. The limitation of this method is PWM Outputs are not currently used to calculate these figures due to the difficulty determining the current consumption of devices driven by PWM signals. The second method for calculating energy consumption is more accurate and is the recommended method if you desire the most accurate estimation of energy consumption and cost. This method relies on an Input or Math measuring Amps. One way to do this is with the used of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that converts the voltage output from a transformer into current (Amps). One wire from the AC line that powers your device(s) passes thorough the transformer and the device converts the current that passes through that wire into a voltage that corresponds to the amperage. For instance, the below sensor converts 0 -50 amps input to 0 - 5 volts output. An ADC receives this output as its input. One would set this conversion range in Mycodo and the calculated amperage will be stored. On the Energy Usage page, add this ADC Input measurement and a report summary will be generated. Keep in mind that for a particular period (for example, the past week) to be accurate, there needs to be a constant measurement of amps at a periodic rate. The faster the rate the more accurate the calculation will be. This is due to the amperage measurements being averaged for this period prior to calculating kWh and cost. If there is any time turing this period where amp measurements aren't being acquired when in fact there are devices consuming current, the calculation is likely to not be accurate. Greystone CS-650-50 AC Solid Core Current Sensor (Transformer) The following settings are for calculating energy usage from an amp measurement.

Additionally, the entire measurement database (influxdb) may be exported as a ZIP archive backup. This ZIP may be imported back in any Mycodo system to restore these measurements. Note Measurements are associated with specific IDs that correspond to the Inputs/Outputs/etc. of your specific system. If you import measurements without also importing the associated Inputs/Outputs/etc., you will not see these measurements (e.g. on Dashboard Graphs). Therefore, it is recommended to export both Measurements and Settings at the same time so when you import them at a later time, you will have the devices associated with the measurements available on the system you're importing to. Note Importing measurement data will not destroy old data and will be added to the current measurement data.

Function controllers perform tasks that often involve the use of Inputs and Outputs. Note \"Last\" means the Function will only acquire the last (latest) measurement in the database. \"Past\" means the Function will acquire all measurements from the present until the \"Max Age (seconds)\" that's been set (e.g. if measurements are acquired every 10 seconds, and a Max Age is set to 60 seconds, there will on average be 6 measurements returned to the Function to operate with). Custom Functions ~ There is a Custom Function import system in Mycodo that allows user-created Functions to be used in the Mycodo system.

PID Controller ~ A proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller is a control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little oscillation. PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller resumes operation. PID Controller Options ~ Setting Description Activate/Deactivate Turn a particular PID controller on or off. Pause When paused, the control variable will not be updated and the PID will not turn on the associated outputs. Settings can be changed without losing current PID output values. Hold When held, the control variable will not be updated but the PID will turn on the associated outputs, Settings can be changed without losing current PID output values. Resume Resume a PID controller from being held or paused. Direction This is the direction that you wish to regulate. For example, if you only require the temperature to be raised, set this to \"Up,\" but if you require regulation up and down, set this to \"Both.\" Period This is the duration between when the PID acquires a measurement, the PID is updated, and the output is modulated. Start Offset (seconds) Wait this duration before attempting the first calculation/measurement. Max Age The time (in seconds) that the sensor measurement age is required to be less than. If the measurement is not younger than this age, the measurement is thrown out and the PID will not actuate the output. This is a safety measure to ensure the PID is only using recent measurements. Setpoint This is the specific point you would like the environment to be regulated at. For example, if you would like the humidity regulated to 60%, enter 60. Band (+/- Setpoint) Hysteresis option. If set to a non-0 value, the setpoint will become a band, which will be between the band_max=setpoint+band and band_min=setpoint-band. If Raising, the PID will raise above band_max, then wait until the condition falls below band_min to resume regulation. If Lowering, the PID will lower below band_min, then wait until the condition rises above band_max to resume regulating. If set to Both, regulation will only occur to the outside min and max of the band, and cease when within the band. Set to 0 to disable Hysteresis. Store Lower as Negative Checking this will store all output variables (PID and output duration/duty cycle) as a negative values in the measurement database. This is useful for displaying graphs that indicate whether the PID is currently lowering or raising. Disable this if you desire all positive values to be stored in the measurement database. K P Gain Proportional coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for present values of the error. For example, if the error is large and positive, the control output will also be large and positive. K I Gain Integral coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for past values of the error. For example, if the current output is not sufficiently strong, the integral of the error will accumulate over time, and the controller will respond by applying a stronger action. K D Gain Derivative coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for predicted future values of the error, based on its current rate of change. Integrator Min The minimum allowed integrator value, for calculating Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki * integrator; and PID output = Kp_total + Ki_total + Kd_total) Integrator Max The maximum allowed integrator value, for calculating Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki * integrator; and PID output = Kp_total + Ki_total + Kd_total) Output (Raise/Lower) This is the output that will cause the particular environmental condition to rise or lower. In the case of raising the temperature, this may be a heating pad or coil. Min On Duration, Duty Cycle, or Amount (Raise/Lower) This is the minimum value that the PID output must be before Output (Lower) turns on. If the PID output is less than this value, Duration Outputs will not turn on, and PWM Outputs will be turned off unless Always Min is enabled. Max On Duration, Duty Cycle, or Amount (Raise/Lower) This is the maximum duration, volume, or duty cycle the Output (Raise) can be set to. If the PID output is greater than this value, the Max value set here will be used. Min Off Duration (Raise/Lower) For On/Off (Duration) Outputs, this is the minimum amount of time the Output must have been off for before it is allowed to turn back on. Ths is useful for devices that can be damaged by rapid power cycling (e.g. fridges). Always Min (Raise/Lower) For PWM Outputs only. If enabled, the duty cycle will never be set below the Min value. Setpoint Tracking Method Set a method to change the setpoint over time. PID Output Calculation ~ PID Controllers can control a number of different output types (e.g. duration, volume, or PWM duty cycle). For most output types, the PID output (Control Variable) will be proportional (i.e. Output Duration = PID Control Variable ). However, when outputting a duty cycle, it will be calculated as Duty Cycle = (Control Variable / Period) * 100 . Note Control Variable = P Output + I Output + D Output. Duty cycle is limited within the 0 - 100 % range and the set Min Duty Cycle and Max Duty Cycle. An output duration is limited by the set Min On Duration and Max On Duration, and output volume similarly. PID Tuning ~ PID tuning can be a complex process, depending on the output device(s) used and the environment or system under control. A system with large perturbations will be more difficult to control than one that is stable. Similarly, output devices that are unsuitable may make PID tuning difficult or impossible. Learning how PID controllers operate and the theory behind their tuning will not only better prepare you to operate a PID controller, but also in the development of your system and selection and implementation of the output devices used to regulate your system. PID Tuning Resources ~ Sous Vide PID Tuning and the Unexpected Electrical Fire PID Control Theory ~ The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in industrial settings, for it\"s ability to handle both simple and complex regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional, integral, and derivative. The P roportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant K P , to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large proportional output. The I ntegral takes the error and multiplies it by K I , then integrates it (K I \u00b7 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will continually sum it and multiply it by the constant K I . The integral is used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using K P alone produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached. The D erivative multiplies the error by K D , then differentiates it (K D \u00b7 s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point. The K P , K I , and K D gains determine how much each of the P, I, and D variables influence the final PID output value. For instance, the greater the value of the gain, the more influence that variable has on the output. The output from the PID controller can be used in a number of ways. A simple use is to use this value as the number of seconds an output is turned on during a periodic interval (Period). For instance, if the Period is set to 30 seconds, the PID equation has the desired measurement and the actual measurement used to calculate the PID output every 30 seconds. The more the output is on during this period, the more it will affect the system. For example, an output on for 15 seconds every 30 seconds is at a 50 % duty cycle, and would affect the system roughly half as much as when the output is on for 30 seconds every 30 seconds, or at at 100 % duty cycle. The PID controller will calculate the output based on the amount of error (how far the actual measurement is from the desired measurement). If the error increases or persists, the output increases, causing the output to turn on for a longer duration within the Period, which usually in term causes the measured condition to change and the error to reduce. When the error reduces, the control variable decreases, meaning the output is turned on for a shorter duration of time. The ultimate goal of a well-tuned PID controller is to bring the actual measurement to the desired measurement quickly, with little overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with minimal oscillation. Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a gain (represented by K P , K I , and K D ). By adjusting the gains, the sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned off. The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This feedback loop, with a properly tuned PID controller, can achieve a set point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance. Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own. Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes K P , K I , and K D can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance, the K I and K D can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the PI controller. It is recommended to start with only K P activated, then experiment with K P and K I , before finally using all three. Because systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output. Quick Setup Examples ~ These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure your K P , K I , and K D gains. There are a number of online resources that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to determine ideal PID values (such as here , here , here , here , and here ) and since there are no universal values that will work for every system, it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively implement them. Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of K P = 30, K I = 1.0, and K D = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of K P = 1.0, K I = 0.2, and K D = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental chamber. Exact Temperature Regulation ~ This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that cools). Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each sensor and activate the sensor. Add two outputs, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state. Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change Setpoint to the desired temperature, Regulate Direction to \"Both\". Set Raise Output to the relay attached to the heating device and the Lower Relay to the relay attached to the cooling device. Set K P = 1, K I = 0, and K D = 0, then activate the PID. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase the K P value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with different configurations involving only Read Interval and K P to achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the K I and K D from 0 until a working regulation is achieved with K P alone. View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with little oscillation around the Setpoint. Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing K P slightly (~25%) and increasing K I by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower, 0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates. Slowly increase K I until regulation becomes both quick and with little oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with experimenting with the system and the K D value can be experimented with once both K P and K I have been tuned. High Temperature Regulation ~ Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed. For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the system and only up-regulation can be used. Use the same configuration as the Exact Temperature Regulation example, except change Regulate Direction to \"Raise\" and do not touch the \"Down Relay\" section. PID Autotune ~ Warning This is an experimental feature. It is best not used until you are familiar with the theory, operation, and tuning of a PID. The Autotune function is a standalone controller that is useful for determining appropriate Kp, Ki, and Kd gains for use in the a PID controller. The autotuner will manipulate an output and analyze the measured response in a particular environment/system. It will take several cycles of perturbing the system with the chosen output before enough data is available to calculate the PID gains. In order to use this feature, select a Measurement and an Output that can module the specific condition being measured. Then, configure the Noise Band and Outstep and activate the function. Log lines of the autotuner will appear in the daemon log ( [Gear Icon] -> Mycodo Logs -> Daemon Log ). While the autotune is being performed, it is recommended to create a dashboard graph that includes the Measurement and Output in order to see what the PID Autotuner is doing and to notice any potential issues with the autotune settings that have been configured. If the autotune is taking a long time to complete, there may not be enough stability in the system being manipulated to calculate a reliable set of PID gains. This may be because there are too many perturbations to the system, or conditions are changing too rapidly to acquire consistent measurement oscillations. If this is the case, try modifying your system to increase stability and yield consistent measurement oscillations. Once the autotune successfully completes, perturbations may be reintroduced in order to further tune the PID controller to handle them. Setting Description Measurement This is the Input or Math measurement that is measuring the specific condition that the Output will affect. For instance, this could be a temperature measurement and the output could be a heater. Output This is the Output that will affect the measurement when it's activated. The autotune function will periodically turn this output on in order to raise the measurement beyond the setpoint. Period This is the period of time between the Output being turned on. This should be set to the same Period you wish to use for your PID controller. A different Period can significantly affect the PID gains that the autotune produces. Setpoint This is the desired measurement condition value. For instance, if temperature is being measured, this should be set a several degrees higher than the current temperature so the output, when activated, will cause the temperature to rise beyond the setpoint. Noise Band This is the amount above the setpoint the measured condition must reach before the output turns off. This is also how much below the setpoint the measured condition must fall before the output turns back on. Outstep This is how many seconds the output will turn on every PID Period. For instance, to autotune with 50% power, ensure the Outstep is half the value of the PID Period. Direction This is the direction for which the Output will push the Measurement. For instance, a heater will raise temperature, whereas a cooler will lower temperature. Typical graph output will look like this: And typical Daemon Log output will look like this: 2018-08-04 23:32:20,876 - mycodo.pid_3b533dff - INFO - Activated in 187.2 ms 2018-08-04 23:32:20,877 - mycodo.pid_autotune -

Conditional Options ~ Setting Description Conditional Statement User-created Python 3 code that will be executed. Period (seconds) The period (seconds) that the Conditional Statement will be executed. Start Offset (seconds) The duration (seconds) to wait before executing the Conditional for the first after it is activated. Log Level: Debug Show debug lines in the daemon log. Message Includes Code Include the Conditional Statement code in the message (self.message) that is passed to Actions. Conditions are functions that can be used within the Conditional Statement, and return specific information. Condition Description Measurement (Single, Last) Acquires the latest measurement from an Input or device. Set Max Age (seconds) to restrict how long to accept values. If the latest value is older than this duration, \"None\" is returned. Measurement (Single, Past, Average) Acquires the past measurements from an Input or device, then averages them. Set Max Age (seconds) to restrict how long to accept values. If all values are older than this duration, \"None\" is returned. Measurement (Single, Past, Sum) Acquires the past measurements from an Input or device, then sums them. Set Max Age (seconds) to restrict how long to accept values. If all values are older than this duration, \"None\" is returned. Measurement (Multiple, Past) Acquires the past measurements from an Input or device. Set Max Age (seconds) to restrict how long to accept values. If no values are found in this duration, \"None\" is returned. This differs from the \"Measurement (Single)\" Condition because it returns a list of dictionaries with 'time' and 'value' key pairs. GPIO State Acquires the current GPIO state and returns 1 if HIGH or 0 if LOW. If the latest value is older than this duration, \"None\" is returned. Output State Returns 'on' if the output is currently on, and 'off' if it's currently off. Output Duration On Returns how long the output has currently been on, in seconds. Returns 0 if off. Controller Running Returns True if the controller is active, False if inactive. Max Age (seconds) The minimum age (seconds) the measurement can be. If the last measurement is older than this, \"None\" will be returned instead of a measurement. Conditional Setup Guide ~ Python 3 is the environment that these conditionals will be executed. The following functions can be used within your Conditional Statement code. Note Python code indentations must use 4 spaces (not 2 spaces, tabs, or anything else). Function Description self.condition(\"{ID}\") Returns a measurement for the Condition with ID. self.condition_dict(\"{ID}\") Returns a dictionary of measurement for the Condition with ID. self.run_action(\"{ID}\") Executes the Action with ID. self.run_all_actions() Executes all actions. self.logger.info() Writes a log line to the Daemon log. \"info\" may also be changed to \"warning\", \"error\" or \"debug\". Debug log lines will only appear in the Daemon log when Logging Level: Debug is enabled for the Input. self.set_custom_option(\"option\", value) Writes the value to the database for retrieval later. The option argument should be a string, and value can be a string, integer, float, list, or dictionary. self.get_custom_option(\"option\") Reads the value from the database that was previously written with self.set_custom_option(). Returns None if the option is not found or there is no value. There are additional functions that can be used, but these must use the full UUID (not an abridged version as the functions above). See /home/pi/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_client.py for the functions available for use. These may be accessed via the 'control' object. An example, below, will return how long the output has been on (or 0 if it's currently off): output_on_seconds = control.output_sec_currently_on(\"1b6ada50-1e69-403a-9fa6-ec748b16dc23\") Since the Python code contained in the Conditional Statement must be formatted properly, it's best to familiarize yourself with the basics of Python . Note There are two different IDs in use here, one set of IDs are found under the Conditions section of the Conditional Controller, and one set of IDs are found under the Actions section of the Conditional Controller. Read all of this section, including the examples, below, to fully understand how to properly set up a Conditional Controller. Info If a measurement hasn't been acquired within the set Max Age , \"None\" will be returned when self.condition(\"{ID}\") is called in the code. It is very important that you account for this. All examples below incorporate a test for the measurement being None, and this should not be removed. If an error occurs (such as if the statement resolves to comparing None to a numerical value, such as \"if None < 23\"), then the code will stop there and an error will be logged in the daemon log. Accounting for None is useful for determining if an Input is no longer acquiring measurements (e.g. dead sensor, malfunction, etc.). To create a basic conditional, follow these steps, using the numbers in the screenshots, below, that correspond to the numbers in parentheses: Navigate to the Setup -> Function page. Select \"Controller: Conditional\", then click Add . Under Conditions (1), select a condition option, then click Add Condition . Configure the newly-added Condition then click Save . Under Actions (2), select an action option, then click Add Action . Configure the newly-added Action then click Save . Notice that each Condition and each Action has its own ID (underlined). The default Conditional Statement (3) contains placeholder IDs that need to be changed to your Condition and Action IDs. Change the ID in self.condition(\"{asdf1234}\") to your Condition ID. Change the ID in self.run_action(\"{qwer5678}\", message=message) to your Action ID. Click Save at the top of the Conditional. The logic used in the Conditional Statement will need to be adjusted to suit your particular needs. Additionally, you may add more Conditions or Actions. See the Advanced Conditional Statement examples , below, for usage examples. If your Conditional Statement has been formatted correctly, your Conditional will save and it will be ready to activate. If an error is returned, your options will not have been saved. Inspect the error for which line is causing the issue and read the error message itself to try to understand what the problem is and how to fix it. There are an unfathomable number of ways to configure a Conditional, but this should hopefully get you started to developing one that suits your needs. Note Mycodo is constantly changing, so the screenshots below may not match what you see exactly. Be sure to read this entire section of the manual to understand how to use Conditional Controllers. Beginner Conditional Statement examples: Each self.condition(\"{ID}\") will return the most recent measurement obtained from that particular measurement under the Conditions section of the Conditional Controller, as long as it's within the set Max Age. # Example 1, no measurement (i.e. None) returned # useful with the Email Notify Action to email when an Input stops working if self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) is None : self . run_all_actions () # Execute all configured actions # Example 2, test two measurement conditions measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: # If neither measurement is None (both are working) if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10 : # If measure_1 is less than 20 and measure_2 is greater than 10 self . run_all_actions () # Execute all configured actions # Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: sum_ = measure_1 + measure_2 if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum_ < 30.5 : self . run_all_actions () # Example 4, combine into one conditional measurement = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is not None and 20 < measurement < 30 : # combine conditions self . run_all_actions () # Example 5, test two measurements # convert Edge Input from 0 or 1 to True or False measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if bool ( measure_1 ) and measure_2 > 10 : self . run_all_actions () # Example 6, test measurement with \"or\" and a rounded measurement measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if measure_1 > 20 or int ( round ( measure_2 )) in [ 20 , 21 , 22 ]: self . run_all_actions () # Example 7, use self to store variables across multiple executions measurement = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if not hasattr ( self , \"stored_measurement\" ): # Initialize variable self . stored_measurement = measurement if measurement is not None : if abs ( measurement - self . stored_measurement ) > 10 : self . run_all_actions () # if difference is greater than 10 self . stored_measurement = measurement # Store measurement The \"Measurement (Multiple)\" Condition is useful if you desire to check if a particular value has been stored in any of the past measurements (within the set Max Age), not just the last measurement. This is useful if you have an alert system that each numerical value represents a different alert that you need to check each past value if it occurred. Here is an example that retrieves all measurements from the past 30 minutes and checks if any of the measurements in the returned list is equal to \"119\". If \"119\" exists, the Actions are executed and break is used to exit the for loop. # Example 1, find a measurement in the past 30 minutes (Max Age: 1800 seconds) measurements = self . condition_dict ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurements : # If the list is not empty for each_measure in measurements : # Loop through each measurement in the list if each_measure [ 'value' ] == 119 : self . logger . info ( \"Alert 119 found at timestamp {time} \" . format ( time = each_measure [ 'time' ])) self . run_all_actions () break # Exit the for loop Advanced Conditional Statement examples: These examples expand on the beginner examples, above, by activating specific actions. The following examples will reference actions with IDs that can be found under the Actions section of the Conditional Controller. Two example action IDs will be used: \"qwer1234\" and \"uiop5678\". Additionally, self.run_all_actions() is used here, which will run all actions in the order in which they were created. # Example 1 measurement = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is None : self . run_action ( \" {qwer1234} \" ) elif measurement > 23 : self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) else : self . run_all_actions () # Example 2, test two measurements measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10 : self . run_action ( \" {qwer1234} \" ) self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) # Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: sum_ = measure_1 + measure_2 if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum_ < 30.5 : self . run_action ( \" {qwer1234} \" ) else : self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) # Example 4, combine into one conditional measurement = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is not None and 20 < measurement < 30 : self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) # Example 5, test two measurements, convert Edge Input from 0/1 to True/False measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if bool ( measure_1 ) and measure_2 > 10 : self . run_all_actions () # Example 6, test measurement with \"or\" and a rounded measurement measure_1 = self . measure ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . measure ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if measure_1 > 20 or int ( round ( measure_2 )) in [ 20 , 21 , 22 ]: self . run_action ( \" {qwer1234} \" ) if measure_1 > 30 : self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) If your Action is a type that receives a message (E-Mail or Note), you can modify this message to include extra information before it is passed to the function (so the new information is passed to the Note, E-Mail, etc.). To do this, append a string to the variable self.message and add this to the message parameter of self.run_action() or self.run_all_actions(). Below are some examples. Note the use of \"+=\" instead of \"=\", which appends the string to the variable self.message instead of overwriting it. # Example 1 measurement = self . measure ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is None and measurement > 23 : self . message += \"Measurement was {} \" . format ( measurement ) self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" , message = self . message ) # Example 2 measure_1 = self . measure ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . measure ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10 : self . message += \"Measurement 1: {m1} , Measurement 2: {m2} \" . format ( m1 = measure_1 , m2 = measure_2 ) self . run_all_actions ( message = self . message ) Logging can also be used to log messages to the daemon log using self.logger . Logging levels include \"info\", \"warning\", \"error\" and \"debug\". Debug log lines will only appear in the Daemon log when Logging Level: Debug is enabled for the Input. # Example 1 measurement = self . measure ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is None and measurement > 23 : self . logging . error ( \"Warning, measurement was {} \" . format ( measurement )) self . message += \"Measurement was {} \" . format ( measurement ) self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" , message = self . message ) Before activating any conditionals, it's advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a configuration that eliminates conflicts. Some devices or outputs may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid succession. Therefore, trial run your configuration before connecting devices to any outputs. Trigger ~ A Trigger Controller will execute actions when events are triggered, such as an output turning on or off, a GPIO pin changing it's voltage state (Edge detection, rising or falling), timed events that include various timers (duration, time period, time point, etc), or the sunrise/sunset time at a specific latitude and longitude. Once the trigger is configured, add any number of Actions to be executed when that event is triggered. Output (On/Off) Options ~ Monitor the state of an output. Setting Description If Output The Output to monitor for a change of state. If State If the state of the output changes to On or Off the conditional will trigger. If \"On (any duration) is selected, th trigger will occur no matter how long the output turns on for, whereas if only \"On\" is selected, the conditional will trigger only when the output turns on for a duration of time equal to the set \"Duration (seconds)\". If Duration (seconds) If \"On\" is selected, an optional duration (seconds) may be set that will trigger the conditional only if the Output is turned on for this specific duration. Output (PWM) Options ~ Monitor the state of a PWM output. Setting Description If Output The Output to monitor for a change of state. If State If the duty cycle of the output is greater than,less than, or equal to the set value, trigger the Conditional Actions. If Duty Cycle (%) The duty cycle for the Output to be checked against. Edge Options ~ Monitor the state of a pin for a rising and/or falling edge. Setting Description If Edge Detected The conditional will be triggered if a change in state is detected, either Rising when the state changes from LOW (0 volts) to HIGH (3.5 volts) or Falling when the state changes from HIGH (3.3 volts) to LOW (0 volts), or Both (Rising and Falling). Run PWM Method Options ~ Select a Duration Method and this will set the selected PWM Output to the duty cycle specified by the method. Setting Description Duration Method Select which Method to use. PWM Output Select which PWM Output to use. Period (seconds) Select the interval of time to calculate the duty cycle, then apply to the PWM Output. Trigger Every Period Trigger Conditional Actions every period. Trigger when Activated Trigger Conditional Actions when the Conditional is activated. Sunrise/Sunset Options ~ Trigger events at sunrise or sunset (or a time offset of those), based on latitude and longitude. Setting Description Rise or Set Select which to trigger the conditional, at sunrise or sunset. Latitude (decimal) Latitude of the sunrise/sunset, using decimal format. Longitude (decimal) Longitude of the sunrise/sunset, using decimal format. Zenith The Zenith angle of the sun. Date Offset (days) Set a sunrise/sunset offset in days (positive or negative). Time Offset (minutes) Set a sunrise/sunset offset in minutes (positive or negative). Timer (Duration) Options ~ Run a timer that triggers Conditional Actions every period. Setting Description Period (seconds) The period of time between triggering Conditional Actions. Start Offset (seconds) Set this to start the first trigger a number of seconds after the Conditional is activated. Timer (Daily Time Point) Options ~ Run a timer that triggers Conditional Actions at a specific time every day. Setting Description Start Time (HH:MM) Set the time to trigger Conditional Actions, in the format \"HH:MM\", with HH denoting hours, and MM denoting minutes. Time is in 24-hour format. Timer (Daily Time Span) Options ~ Run a timer that triggers Conditional Actions at a specific period if it's between the set start and end times. For example, if the Start Time is set to 10:00 and End Time set to 11:00 and Period set to 120 seconds, the Conditional Actions will trigger every 120 seconds when the time is between 10 AM and 11 AM. This may be useful, for instance, if you desire an Output to remain on during a particular time period and you want to prevent power outages from interrupting the cycle (which a simple Time Point Timer could not prevent against because it only triggers once at the Start Time). By setting an Output to turn the lights on every few minutes during the Start -> End period, it ensured the Output remains on during this period. Setting Description Start Time (HH:MM) Set the start time to trigger Conditional Actions, in the format \"HH:MM\", with HH denoting hours, and MM denoting minutes. Time is in 24-hour format. End Time (HH:MM) Set the end time to trigger Conditional Actions, in the format \"HH:MM\", with HH denoting hours, and MM denoting minutes. Time is in 24-hour format. Period (seconds) The period of time between triggering Conditional Actions. Function Actions ~ These are the actions that can be added to Controllers (i.e. Conditional, Trigger). Setting Description Actions: Pause Pause executing actions for a duration of time (seconds). Camera: Capture Photo Capture a photo with the selected camera. Create Note Create a note containing the conditional statement and actions, using a particular tag. Controller: Activate Activate a particular controller. Controller: Deactivate Deactivate a particular controller. E-Mail Send an email containing the conditional statement and actions. E-Mail with Photo Attachment Send an email containing the conditional statement, actions, and captured photo. E-Mail with Video Attachment Send an email containing the conditional statement, actions, and captured video. Execute Command Execute a command in the linux shell (as user 'root'). LCD: Backlight Turn the LCD backlight on or off. Note: Only some LCDs are supported. LCD: Flash Start of stop the LCD flashing to indicate an alert. Note: Only some LCDs are supported.

Resume Resume a PID controller from being held or paused. Direction This is the direction that you wish to regulate. For example, if you only require the temperature to be raised, set this to \"Up,\" but if you require regulation up and down, set this to \"Both.\" Period This is the duration between when the PID acquires a measurement, the PID is updated, and the output is modulated. Start Offset (seconds) Wait this duration before attempting the first calculation/measurement. Max Age The time (in seconds) that the sensor measurement age is required to be less than. If the measurement is not younger than this age, the measurement is thrown out and the PID will not actuate the output. This is a safety measure to ensure the PID is only using recent measurements. Setpoint This is the specific point you would like the environment to be regulated at. For example, if you would like the humidity regulated to 60%, enter 60. Band (+/- Setpoint) Hysteresis option. If set to a non-0 value, the setpoint will become a band, which will be between the band_max=setpoint+band and band_min=setpoint-band. If Raising, the PID will raise above band_max, then wait until the condition falls below band_min to resume regulation. If Lowering, the PID will lower below band_min, then wait until the condition rises above band_max to resume regulating. If set to Both, regulation will only occur to the outside min and max of the band, and cease when within the band. Set to 0 to disable Hysteresis. Store Lower as Negative Checking this will store all output variables (PID and output duration/duty cycle) as a negative values in the measurement database. This is useful for displaying graphs that indicate whether the PID is currently lowering or raising. Disable this if you desire all positive values to be stored in the measurement database. K P Gain Proportional coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for present values of the error. For example, if the error is large and positive, the control output will also be large and positive. K I Gain Integral coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for past values of the error. For example, if the current output is not sufficiently strong, the integral of the error will accumulate over time, and the controller will respond by applying a stronger action. K D Gain Derivative coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for predicted future values of the error, based on its current rate of change. Integrator Min The minimum allowed integrator value, for calculating Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki * integrator; and PID output = Kp_total + Ki_total + Kd_total) Integrator Max The maximum allowed integrator value, for calculating Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki * integrator; and PID output = Kp_total + Ki_total + Kd_total) Output (Raise/Lower) This is the output that will cause the particular environmental condition to rise or lower. In the case of raising the temperature, this may be a heating pad or coil. Min On Duration, Duty Cycle, or Amount (Raise/Lower) This is the minimum value that the PID output must be before Output (Lower) turns on.

Max On Duration, Duty Cycle, or Amount (Raise/Lower) This is the maximum duration, volume, or duty cycle the Output (Raise) can be set to. If the PID output is greater than this value, the Max value set here will be used. Min Off Duration (Raise/Lower) For On/Off (Duration) Outputs, this is the minimum amount of time the Output must have been off for before it is allowed to turn back on.

The PID controller has three paths, the proportional, integral, and derivative. The P roportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant K P , to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large proportional output. The I ntegral takes the error and multiplies it by K I , then integrates it (K I \u00b7 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will continually sum it and multiply it by the constant K I . The integral is used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using K P alone produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached. The D erivative multiplies the error by K D , then differentiates it (K D \u00b7 s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point. The K P , K I , and K D gains determine how much each of the P, I, and D variables influence the final PID output value. For instance, the greater the value of the gain, the more influence that variable has on the output. The output from the PID controller can be used in a number of ways. A simple use is to use this value as the number of seconds an output is turned on during a periodic interval (Period). For instance, if the Period is set to 30 seconds, the PID equation has the desired measurement and the actual measurement used to calculate the PID output every 30 seconds. The more the output is on during this period, the more it will affect the system. For example, an output on for 15 seconds every 30 seconds is at a 50 % duty cycle, and would affect the system roughly half as much as when the output is on for 30 seconds every 30 seconds, or at at 100 % duty cycle. The PID controller will calculate the output based on the amount of error (how far the actual measurement is from the desired measurement). If the error increases or persists, the output increases, causing the output to turn on for a longer duration within the Period, which usually in term causes the measured condition to change and the error to reduce. When the error reduces, the control variable decreases, meaning the output is turned on for a shorter duration of time. The ultimate goal of a well-tuned PID controller is to bring the actual measurement to the desired measurement quickly, with little overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with minimal oscillation. Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a gain (represented by K P , K I , and K D ). By adjusting the gains, the sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned off. The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This feedback loop, with a properly tuned PID controller, can achieve a set point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance. Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own. Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes K P , K I , and K D can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance, the K I and K D can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the PI controller. It is recommended to start with only K P activated, then experiment with K P and K I , before finally using all three. Because systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.","title":"PID Control Theory"},{"location":"Functions/#quick-setup-examples","text":"These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure your K P , K I , and K D gains. There are a number of online resources that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to determine ideal PID values (such as here , here , here , here , and here ) and since there are no universal values that will work for every system, it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively implement them. Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of K P = 30, K I = 1.0, and K D = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of K P = 1.0, K I = 0.2, and K D = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental chamber.","title":"Quick Setup Examples"},{"location":"Functions/#exact-temperature-regulation","text":"This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that cools). Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each sensor and activate the sensor. Add two outputs, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state. Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change Setpoint to the desired temperature, Regulate Direction to \"Both\". Set Raise Output to the relay attached to the heating device and the Lower Relay to the relay attached to the cooling device. Set K P = 1, K I = 0, and K D = 0, then activate the PID. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase the K P value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with different configurations involving only Read Interval and K P to achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the K I and K D from 0 until a working regulation is achieved with K P alone. View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with little oscillation around the Setpoint. Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing K P slightly (~25%) and increasing K I by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower, 0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates. Slowly increase K I until regulation becomes both quick and with little oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with experimenting with the system and the K D value can be experimented with once both K P and K I have been tuned.","title":"Exact Temperature Regulation"},{"location":"Functions/#high-temperature-regulation","text":"Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed. For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the system and only up-regulation can be used. Use the same configuration as the Exact Temperature Regulation example, except change Regulate Direction to \"Raise\" and do not touch the \"Down Relay\" section.","title":"High Temperature Regulation"},{"location":"Functions/#pid-autotune","text":"Warning This is an experimental feature. It is best not used until you are familiar with the theory, operation, and tuning of a PID. The Autotune function is a standalone controller that is useful for determining appropriate Kp, Ki, and Kd gains for use in the a PID controller. The autotuner will manipulate an output and analyze the measured response in a particular environment/system. It will take several cycles of perturbing the system with the chosen output before enough data is available to calculate the PID gains. In order to use this feature, select a Measurement and an Output that can module the specific condition being measured. Then, configure the Noise Band and Outstep and activate the function. Log lines of the autotuner will appear in the daemon log ( [Gear Icon] -> Mycodo Logs -> Daemon Log ). While the autotune is being performed, it is recommended to create a dashboard graph that includes the Measurement and Output in order to see what the PID Autotuner is doing and to notice any potential issues with the autotune settings that have been configured. If the autotune is taking a long time to complete, there may not be enough stability in the system being manipulated to calculate a reliable set of PID gains. This may be because there are too many perturbations to the system, or conditions are changing too rapidly to acquire consistent measurement oscillations. If this is the case, try modifying your system to increase stability and yield consistent measurement oscillations. Once the autotune successfully completes, perturbations may be reintroduced in order to further tune the PID controller to handle them. Setting Description Measurement This is the Input or Math measurement that is measuring the specific condition that the Output will affect. For instance, this could be a temperature measurement and the output could be a heater. Output This is the Output that will affect the measurement when it's activated. The autotune function will periodically turn this output on in order to raise the measurement beyond the setpoint. Period This is the period of time between the Output being turned on. This should be set to the same Period you wish to use for your PID controller. A different Period can significantly affect the PID gains that the autotune produces. Setpoint This is the desired measurement condition value. For instance, if temperature is being measured, this should be set a several degrees higher than the current temperature so the output, when activated, will cause the temperature to rise beyond the setpoint. Noise Band This is the amount above the setpoint the measured condition must reach before the output turns off. This is also how much below the setpoint the measured condition must fall before the output turns back on. Outstep This is how many seconds the output will turn on every PID Period. For instance, to autotune with 50% power, ensure the Outstep is half the value of the PID Period. Direction This is the direction for which the Output will push the Measurement. For instance, a heater will raise temperature, whereas a cooler will lower temperature. Typical graph output will look like this: And typical Daemon Log output will look like this: 2018-08-04 23:32:20,876 - mycodo.pid_3b533dff - INFO - Activated in 187.2 ms 2018-08-04 23:32:20,877 - mycodo.pid_autotune -

Note There are two different IDs in use here, one set of IDs are found under the Conditions section of the Conditional Controller, and one set of IDs are found under the Actions section of the Conditional Controller. Read all of this section, including the examples, below, to fully understand how to properly set up a Conditional Controller. Info If a measurement hasn't been acquired within the set Max Age , \"None\" will be returned when self.condition(\"{ID}\") is called in the code. It is very important that you account for this. All examples below incorporate a test for the measurement being None, and this should not be removed. If an error occurs (such as if the statement resolves to comparing None to a numerical value, such as \"if None < 23\"), then the code will stop there and an error will be logged in the daemon log. Accounting for None is useful for determining if an Input is no longer acquiring measurements (e.g. dead sensor, malfunction, etc.). To create a basic conditional, follow these steps, using the numbers in the screenshots, below, that correspond to the numbers in parentheses: Navigate to the Setup -> Function page. Select \"Controller: Conditional\", then click Add . Under Conditions (1), select a condition option, then click Add Condition . Configure the newly-added Condition then click Save . Under Actions (2), select an action option, then click Add Action . Configure the newly-added Action then click Save . Notice that each Condition and each Action has its own ID (underlined). The default Conditional Statement (3) contains placeholder IDs that need to be changed to your Condition and Action IDs. Change the ID in self.condition(\"{asdf1234}\") to your Condition ID. Change the ID in self.run_action(\"{qwer5678}\", message=message) to your Action ID. Click Save at the top of the Conditional. The logic used in the Conditional Statement will need to be adjusted to suit your particular needs. Additionally, you may add more Conditions or Actions. See the Advanced Conditional Statement examples , below, for usage examples. If your Conditional Statement has been formatted correctly, your Conditional will save and it will be ready to activate. If an error is returned, your options will not have been saved. Inspect the error for which line is causing the issue and read the error message itself to try to understand what the problem is and how to fix it. There are an unfathomable number of ways to configure a Conditional, but this should hopefully get you started to developing one that suits your needs. Note Mycodo is constantly changing, so the screenshots below may not match what you see exactly. Be sure to read this entire section of the manual to understand how to use Conditional Controllers. Beginner Conditional Statement examples: Each self.condition(\"{ID}\") will return the most recent measurement obtained from that particular measurement under the Conditions section of the Conditional Controller, as long as it's within the set Max Age. # Example 1, no measurement (i.e. None) returned # useful with the Email Notify Action to email when an Input stops working if self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) is None : self . run_all_actions () # Execute all configured actions # Example 2, test two measurement conditions measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: # If neither measurement is None (both are working) if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10 : # If measure_1 is less than 20 and measure_2 is greater than 10 self . run_all_actions () # Execute all configured actions # Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: sum_ = measure_1 + measure_2 if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum_ < 30.5 : self . run_all_actions () # Example 4, combine into one conditional measurement = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is not None and 20 < measurement < 30 : # combine conditions self . run_all_actions () # Example 5, test two measurements # convert Edge Input from 0 or 1 to True or False measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if bool ( measure_1 ) and measure_2 > 10 : self . run_all_actions () # Example 6, test measurement with \"or\" and a rounded measurement measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if measure_1 > 20 or int ( round ( measure_2 )) in [ 20 , 21 , 22 ]: self . run_all_actions () # Example 7, use self to store variables across multiple executions measurement = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if not hasattr ( self , \"stored_measurement\" ): # Initialize variable self . stored_measurement = measurement if measurement is not None : if abs ( measurement - self . stored_measurement ) > 10 : self . run_all_actions () # if difference is greater than 10 self . stored_measurement = measurement # Store measurement The \"Measurement (Multiple)\" Condition is useful if you desire to check if a particular value has been stored in any of the past measurements (within the set Max Age), not just the last measurement. This is useful if you have an alert system that each numerical value represents a different alert that you need to check each past value if it occurred. Here is an example that retrieves all measurements from the past 30 minutes and checks if any of the measurements in the returned list is equal to \"119\". If \"119\" exists, the Actions are executed and break is used to exit the for loop. # Example 1, find a measurement in the past 30 minutes (Max Age: 1800 seconds) measurements = self . condition_dict ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurements : # If the list is not empty for each_measure in measurements : # Loop through each measurement in the list if each_measure [ 'value' ] == 119 : self . logger . info ( \"Alert 119 found at timestamp {time} \" . format ( time = each_measure [ 'time' ])) self . run_all_actions () break # Exit the for loop Advanced Conditional Statement examples: These examples expand on the beginner examples, above, by activating specific actions. The following examples will reference actions with IDs that can be found under the Actions section of the Conditional Controller. Two example action IDs will be used: \"qwer1234\" and \"uiop5678\". Additionally, self.run_all_actions() is used here, which will run all actions in the order in which they were created. # Example 1 measurement = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is None : self . run_action ( \" {qwer1234} \" ) elif measurement > 23 : self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) else : self . run_all_actions () # Example 2, test two measurements measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10 : self . run_action ( \" {qwer1234} \" ) self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) # Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: sum_ = measure_1 + measure_2 if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum_ < 30.5 : self . run_action ( \" {qwer1234} \" ) else : self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) # Example 4, combine into one conditional measurement = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is not None and 20 < measurement < 30 : self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) # Example 5, test two measurements, convert Edge Input from 0/1 to True/False measure_1 = self . condition ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . condition ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if bool ( measure_1 ) and measure_2 > 10 : self . run_all_actions () # Example 6, test measurement with \"or\" and a rounded measurement measure_1 = self . measure ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . measure ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if measure_1 > 20 or int ( round ( measure_2 )) in [ 20 , 21 , 22 ]: self . run_action ( \" {qwer1234} \" ) if measure_1 > 30 : self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" ) If your Action is a type that receives a message (E-Mail or Note), you can modify this message to include extra information before it is passed to the function (so the new information is passed to the Note, E-Mail, etc.). To do this, append a string to the variable self.message and add this to the message parameter of self.run_action() or self.run_all_actions(). Below are some examples. Note the use of \"+=\" instead of \"=\", which appends the string to the variable self.message instead of overwriting it. # Example 1 measurement = self . measure ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is None and measurement > 23 : self . message += \"Measurement was {} \" . format ( measurement ) self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" , message = self . message ) # Example 2 measure_1 = self . measure ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) measure_2 = self . measure ( \" {hjkl5678} \" ) if None not in [ measure_1 , measure_2 ]: if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10 : self . message += \"Measurement 1: {m1} , Measurement 2: {m2} \" . format ( m1 = measure_1 , m2 = measure_2 ) self . run_all_actions ( message = self . message ) Logging can also be used to log messages to the daemon log using self.logger . Logging levels include \"info\", \"warning\", \"error\" and \"debug\". Debug log lines will only appear in the Daemon log when Logging Level: Debug is enabled for the Input. # Example 1 measurement = self . measure ( \" {asdf1234} \" ) if measurement is None and measurement > 23 : self . logging . error ( \"Warning, measurement was {} \" . format ( measurement )) self . message += \"Measurement was {} \" . format ( measurement ) self . run_action ( \" {uiop5678} \" , message = self . message ) Before activating any conditionals, it's advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a configuration that eliminates conflicts. Some devices or outputs may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid succession. Therefore, trial run your configuration before connecting devices to any outputs.","title":"Conditional Setup Guide"},{"location":"Functions/#trigger","text":"A Trigger Controller will execute actions when events are triggered, such as an output turning on or off, a GPIO pin changing it's voltage state (Edge detection, rising or falling), timed events that include various timers (duration, time period, time point, etc), or the sunrise/sunset time at a specific latitude and longitude.

Some inputs may have the same address (such as the AM2315), which prevents more than one from being connected at the same time. Others may provide the ability to change the address, however the address range may be limited, which limits by how many you can use at the same time. I2C multiplexers are extremely clever and useful in these scenarios because they allow multiple sensors with the same I2C address to be connected. For instance, the TCA9548A/PCA9548A: I2C Multiplexer has 8 selectable addresses, so 8 multiplexers can be connected to one Raspberry Pi. Each multiplexer has 8 channels, allowing up to 8 devices/sensors with the same address to be connected to each multiplexer. 8 multiplexers x 8 channels = 64 devices/sensors with the same I2C address. Multiplexers can be set up by loading a kernel driver to handle the communication, producing a new I2C bus device for each multiplexer channel. To enable the driver for the TCA9548A/PCA9548A, visit GPIO-pca9548 to get the code and latest install instructions. If successfully set up, there will be 8 new I2C buses on the [Gear Icon] -> System Information page. The driver for the TCA9545A can be found at https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a and other drivers are available elsewhere. See the manufacturer or user forums for details.

Inputs, such as sensors, ADC signals, or even a response from a command, enable measuring conditions in the environment or elsewhere, which will be stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB). This database will provide measurements for Dashboards , LCDs , PID Controllers , Conditional Statements , and other parts of Mycodo to operate from. Add, configure, and activate inputs to begin recording measurements to the database and allow them to be used throughout Mycodo. Custom Inputs ~ See Building a Custom Input Module Wiki page. There is a Custom Input import system in Mycodo that allows user-created Inputs to be created an used in the Mycodo system. Custom Inputs can be uploaded and imported from the [Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Custom Inputs page. After import, they will be available to use on the Setup -> Input page. If you develop a working Input module, please consider creating a new GitHub issue or pull request, and it may be included in the built-in set. Open any of the built-in modules located in the directory Mycodo/mycodo/inputs for examples of the proper formatting. There are also example Custom Inputs in the directory Mycodo/mycodo/inputs/examples Additionally, I have another github repository devoted to Custom Modules that are not included in the built-in set, at kizniche/Mycodo-custom . Input Actions ~ Input Actions are functions within the Input module that can be executed from the Web UI. This is useful for things such as calibration or other functionality specific to the input. By default, there is at least one action, Acquire Measurements Now, which will cause the input to acquire measurements rather than waiting until the next Period has elapsed. Note Actions can only be executed while the Input is active. Input Options ~ Setting Description Activate After the sensor has been properly configured, activation begins acquiring measurements from the sensor. Any activated conditional statements will now being operating. Deactivate Deactivation stops measurements from being acquired from the sensor. All associated conditional statements will cease to operate. Save Save the current configuration entered into the input boxes for a particular sensor. Delete Delete a particular sensor. Acquire Measurements Now Force the input to conduct measurements and them in the database. Up/Down Move a particular sensor up or down in the order displayed. Power Output Select a output that powers the sensor. This enables powering cycling (turn off then on) when the sensor returns 3 consecutive errors to attempt to fix the issue. Transistors may also be used instead of a relay (note: NPN transistors are preferred over PNP for powering sensors). Location Depending on what sensor is being used, you will need to either select a serial number (DS18B20 temperature sensor), a GPIO pin (in the case of sensors read by a GPIO), or an I2C address. or other. I2C Bus The bus to be used to communicate with the I2C address. Period (seconds) After the sensor is successfully read and a database entry is made, this is the duration of time waited until the sensor is measured again. Measurement Unit Select the unit to save the measurement as (only available for select measurements). Pre Output If you require a output to be activated before a measurement is made (for instance, if you have a pump that extracts air to a chamber where the sensor resides), this is the output number that will be activated. The output will be activated for a duration defined by the Pre Duration, then once the output turns off, a measurement by the sensor is made. Pre Output Duration (seconds) This is the duration of time that the Pre Output runs for before the sensor measurement is obtained. Pre Output During Measurement If enabled, the Pre Output stays on during the acquisition of a measurement. If disabled, the Pre Output is turned off directly before acquiring a measurement. Command A linux command (executed as the user 'root') that the return value becomes the measurement Command Measurement The measured condition (e.g. temperature, humidity, etc.) from the linux command Command Units The units of the measurement condition from the linux command Edge Edge sensors only: Select whether the Rising or Falling (or both) edges of a changing voltage are detected. A number of devices to do this when in-line with a circuit supplying a 3.3-volt input signal to a GPIO, such as simple mechanical switch, a button, a magnet (reed/hall) sensor, a PIR motion detector, and more. Bounce Time (ms) Edge sensors only: This is the number of milliseconds to bounce the input signal. This is commonly called debouncing a signal [1] and may be necessary if using a mechanical circuit. Reset Period (seconds) Edge sensors only: This is the period of time after an edge detection that another edge will not be recorded. This enables devices such as PIR motion sensors that may stay activated for longer periods of time. Measurement Analog-to-digital converter only: The type of measurement being acquired by the ADC. For instance, if the resistance of a photocell is being measured through a voltage divider, this measurement would be \"light\". Units Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the unit of the measurement. With the above example of \"light\" as the measurement, the unit may be \"lux\" or \"intensity\". BT Adapter The Bluetooth adapter to communicate with the input. Clock Pin The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the Clock pin of the ADC CS Pin The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the CS pin of the ADC MISO Pin The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the MISO pin of the ADC MOSI Pin The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the MOSI pin of the ADC RTD Probe Type Select to measure from a PT100 or PT1000 probe. Resistor Reference (Ohm) If your reference resistor is not the default (400 Ohm for PT100, 4000 Ohm for PT1000), you can manually set this value. Several manufacturers now use 430 Ohm resistors on their circuit boards, therefore it's recommended to verify the accuracy of your measurements and adjust this value if necessary. Channel Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the channel to obtain the voltage measurement from the ADC. Gain Analog-to-digital converter only: set the gain when acquiring the measurement. Sample Speed Analog-to-digital converter only: set the sample speed (typically samples per second). Volts Min Analog-to-digital converter only: What is the minimum voltage to use when scaling to produce the unit value for the database. For instance, if your ADC is not expected to measure below 0.2 volts for your particular circuit, set this to \"0.2\". Volts Max Analog-to-digital converter only: This is similar to the Min option above, however it is setting the ceiling to the voltage range. Units Min Analog-to-digital converter only: This value will be the lower value of a range that will use the Min and Max Voltages, above, to produce a unit output. For instance, if your voltage range is 0.0 -1.0 volts, and the unit range is 1 -60, and a voltage of 0.5 is measured, in addition to 0.5 being stored in the database, 30 will be stored as well. This enables creating calibrated scales to use with your particular circuit. Units Max Analog-to-digital converter only: This is similar to the Min option above, however it is setting the ceiling to the unit range. Weighting The This is a number between 0 and 1 and indicates how much the old reading affects the new reading. It defaults to 0 which means the old reading has no effect. This may be used to smooth the data. Pulses Per Rev The number of pulses for a complete revolution. Port The server port to be queried (Server Port Open input). Times to Check The number of times to attempt to ping a server (Server Ping input). Deadline (seconds) The maximum amount of time to wait for each ping attempt, after which 0 (offline) will be returned (Server Ping input). Number of Measurement The number of unique measurements to store data for this input. Application ID The Application ID on The Things Network. App API Key The Application API Key on The Things Network. Device ID The Device ID of the Application on The Things Network. Debouncing a signal The Things Network ~ The Things Network (TTN) Input module enables downloading of data from TTN if the Data Storage Integration is enabled in your TTN Application. The Data Storage Integration will store data for up to 7 days. Mycodo will download this data periodically and store the measurements locally. The payload on TTN must be properly decoded to variables that correspond to the \"Variable Name\" option under \"Channel Options\", in the lower section of the Input options. For instance, in your TTN Application, if a custom Payload Format is selected, the decoder code may look like this: function Decoder ( bytes , port ) { var decoded = {}; var rawTemp = bytes [ 0 ] + bytes [ 1 ] * 256 ; decoded . temperature = sflt162f ( rawTemp ) * 100 ; return decoded ; } function sflt162f ( rawSflt16 ) { rawSflt16 &= 0xFFFF ; if ( rawSflt16 === 0x8000 ) return - 0.0 ; var sSign = (( rawSflt16 & 0x8000 ) !== 0 ) ? - 1 : 1 ; var exp1 = ( rawSflt16 >> 11 ) & 0xF ; var mant1 = ( rawSflt16 & 0x7FF ) / 2048.0 ; return sSign * mant1 * Math . pow ( 2 , exp1 - 15 ); } This will decode the 2-byte payload into a temperature float value with the name \"temperature\". Set \"Number of Measurements\" to \"1\", then set the \"Variable Name\" for the first channel (CH0) to \"temperature\" and the \"Measurement Unit\" to \"Temperature: Celsius (\u00b0C)\". Upon activation of the Input, data will be downloaded for the past 7 days. The latest data timestamp will be stored so any subsequent activation of the Input will only download new data (since the last known timestamp). This Input also allows multiple measurements to be stored. You merely have to change \"Number of Measurements\" to a number larger than 1, save, and there will now be multiple variable names and measurement units to set. There are several example Input modules that, in addition to storing the measurements of a sensor in the influx database, will write the measurements to a serial device. This is useful of you have a LoRaWAN transmitter connected via serial to receive measurement information from Mycodo and transmit it to a LoRaWAN gateway (and subsequently to The Things Network). The data on TTN can then be downloaded elsewhere with the TTN Input. These example Input modules are located in the following locations: ~/Mycodo/mycodo/inputs/examples/bme280_ttn.py ~/Mycodo/mycodo/inputs/examples/k30_ttn.py For example, the following excerpt from bme_280.py will write a set of comma-separated strings to the user-specified serial device with the first string (the letter \"B\") used to denote the sensor/measurements, followed by the actual measurements (humidity, pressure, and temperature, in this case). string_send = 'B, {} , {} , {} ' . format ( return_dict [ 1 ][ 'value' ], return_dict [ 2 ][ 'value' ], return_dict [ 0 ][ 'value' ]) self . serial_send = self . serial . Serial ( self . serial_device , 9600 ) self . serial_send . write ( string_send . encode ()) This is useful if multiple data strings are to be sent to the same serial device (e.g. if both bme280_ttn.py and k30_ttn.py are being used at the same time), allowing the serial device to distinguish what data is being received. The full code used to decode both bme280_ttn.py and k30_ttn.py , with informative comments, is located at ~/Mycodo/mycodo/inputs/examples/ttn_data_storage_decoder_example.js .

Clock Pin The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the Clock pin of the ADC CS Pin The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the CS pin of the ADC MISO Pin The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the MISO pin of the ADC MOSI Pin The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the MOSI pin of the ADC RTD Probe Type Select to measure from a PT100 or PT1000 probe. Resistor Reference (Ohm) If your reference resistor is not the default (400 Ohm for PT100, 4000 Ohm for PT1000), you can manually set this value. Several manufacturers now use 430 Ohm resistors on their circuit boards, therefore it's recommended to verify the accuracy of your measurements and adjust this value if necessary. Channel Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the channel to obtain the voltage measurement from the ADC. Gain Analog-to-digital converter only: set the gain when acquiring the measurement. Sample Speed Analog-to-digital converter only: set the sample speed (typically samples per second). Volts Min Analog-to-digital converter only: What is the minimum voltage to use when scaling to produce the unit value for the database. For instance, if your ADC is not expected to measure below 0.2 volts for your particular circuit, set this to \"0.2\". Volts Max Analog-to-digital converter only: This is similar to the Min option above, however it is setting the ceiling to the voltage range. Units Min Analog-to-digital converter only: This value will be the lower value of a range that will use the Min and Max Voltages, above, to produce a unit output. For instance, if your voltage range is 0.0 -1.0 volts, and the unit range is 1 -60, and a voltage of 0.5 is measured, in addition to 0.5 being stored in the database, 30 will be stored as well. This enables creating calibrated scales to use with your particular circuit. Units Max Analog-to-digital converter only: This is similar to the Min option above, however it is setting the ceiling to the unit range. Weighting The This is a number between 0 and 1 and indicates how much the old reading affects the new reading. It defaults to 0 which means the old reading has no effect. This may be used to smooth the data. Pulses Per Rev The number of pulses for a complete revolution. Port The server port to be queried (Server Port Open input). Times to Check The number of times to attempt to ping a server (Server Ping input). Deadline (seconds) The maximum amount of time to wait for each ping attempt, after which 0 (offline) will be returned (Server Ping input). Number of Measurement The number of unique measurements to store data for this input. Application ID The Application ID on The Things Network. App API Key The Application API Key on The Things Network. Device ID The Device ID of the Application on The Things Network.

The Data Storage Integration will store data for up to 7 days. Mycodo will download this data periodically and store the measurements locally. The payload on TTN must be properly decoded to variables that correspond to the \"Variable Name\" option under \"Channel Options\", in the lower section of the Input options. For instance, in your TTN Application, if a custom Payload Format is selected, the decoder code may look like this: function Decoder ( bytes , port ) { var decoded = {}; var rawTemp = bytes [ 0 ] + bytes [ 1 ] * 256 ; decoded . temperature = sflt162f ( rawTemp ) * 100 ; return decoded ; } function sflt162f ( rawSflt16 ) { rawSflt16 &= 0xFFFF ; if ( rawSflt16 === 0x8000 ) return - 0.0 ; var sSign = (( rawSflt16 & 0x8000 ) !== 0 ) ? - 1 : 1 ; var exp1 = ( rawSflt16 >> 11 ) & 0xF ; var mant1 = ( rawSflt16 & 0x7FF ) / 2048.0 ; return sSign * mant1 * Math . pow ( 2 , exp1 - 15 ); } This will decode the 2-byte payload into a temperature float value with the name \"temperature\". Set \"Number of Measurements\" to \"1\", then set the \"Variable Name\" for the first channel (CH0) to \"temperature\" and the \"Measurement Unit\" to \"Temperature: Celsius (\u00b0C)\". Upon activation of the Input, data will be downloaded for the past 7 days. The latest data timestamp will be stored so any subsequent activation of the Input will only download new data (since the last known timestamp). This Input also allows multiple measurements to be stored. You merely have to change \"Number of Measurements\" to a number larger than 1, save, and there will now be multiple variable names and measurement units to set. There are several example Input modules that, in addition to storing the measurements of a sensor in the influx database, will write the measurements to a serial device. This is useful of you have a LoRaWAN transmitter connected via serial to receive measurement information from Mycodo and transmit it to a LoRaWAN gateway (and subsequently to The Things Network). The data on TTN can then be downloaded elsewhere with the TTN Input. These example Input modules are located in the following locations: ~/Mycodo/mycodo/inputs/examples/bme280_ttn.py ~/Mycodo/mycodo/inputs/examples/k30_ttn.py For example, the following excerpt from bme_280.py will write a set of comma-separated strings to the user-specified serial device with the first string (the letter \"B\") used to denote the sensor/measurements, followed by the actual measurements (humidity, pressure, and temperature, in this case). string_send = 'B, {} , {} , {} ' . format ( return_dict [ 1 ][ 'value' ], return_dict [ 2 ][ 'value' ], return_dict [ 0 ][ 'value' ]) self . serial_send = self . serial . Serial ( self . serial_device , 9600 ) self . serial_send . write ( string_send . encode ()) This is useful if multiple data strings are to be sent to the same serial device (e.g. if both bme280_ttn.py and k30_ttn.py are being used at the same time), allowing the serial device to distinguish what data is being received. The full code used to decode both bme280_ttn.py and k30_ttn.py , with informative comments, is located at ~/Mycodo/mycodo/inputs/examples/ttn_data_storage_decoder_example.js .

Normally, a PID controller will regulate an environmental condition to a specific setpoint. If you would like the setpoint to change over time, this is called setpoint tracking. Setpoint Tracking is useful for applications such as reflow ovens, thermal cyclers (DNA replication), mimicking natural daily cycles, and more. Methods may also be used to change a duty cycle over time when used with a Run PWM Method Conditional. Method Options ~ These options are shared with several method types. Setting Description Start Time/Date This is the start time of a range of time. End Time/Date This is the end time of a range of time. Start Setpoint This is the start setpoint of a range of setpoints. End Setpoint This is the end setpoint of a range of setpoints. Time/Date Method ~ A time/date method allows a specific time/date span to dictate the setpoint. This is useful for long-running methods, that may take place over the period of days, weeks, or months. Duration Method ~ A Duration Method allows a Setpoint (for PIDs) or Duty Cycle (for Conditional) to be set after specific durations of time. Each new duration added will stack, meaning it will come after the previous duration, meaning a newly-added Start Setpoint will begin after the previous entry's End Setpoint . If the \"Repeat Method\" option is used, this will cause the method to repeat once it has reached the end. If this option is used, no more durations may be added to the method. If the repeat option is deleted then more durations may be added. For instance, if your method is 200 seconds total, if the Repeat Duration is set to 600 seconds, the method will repeat 3 times and then automatically turn off the PID or Conditional. Daily (Time-Based) Method ~ The daily time-based method is similar to the time/date method, however it will repeat every day. Therefore, it is essential that only the span of one day be set in this method. Begin with the start time at 00:00:00 and end at 23:59:59 (or 00:00:00, which would be 24 hours from the start). The start time must be equal or greater than the previous end time. Daily (Sine Wave) Method ~ The daily sine wave method defines the setpoint over the day based on a sinusoidal wave. The sine wave is defined by y = [A * sin(B * x + C)] + D, where A is amplitude, B is frequency, C is the angle shift, and D is the y-axis shift. This method will repeat daily. Daily (Bezier Curve) Method ~ A daily Bezier curve method define the setpoint over the day based on a cubic Bezier curve. If unfamiliar with a Bezier curve, it is recommended you use the graphical Bezier curve generator and use the 8 variables it creates for 4 points (each a set of x and y). The x-axis start (x3) and end (x0) will be automatically stretched or skewed to fit within a 24-hour period and this method will repeat daily. Cascade Method ~ This method combines multiple methods and outputs the average of the methods. For examples, let's combine a Duration method set to 100 for 60 seconds and 0 for 60 seconds (and set to repeat forever) with a Daily Method that rises from 0 at 00:00:00 to 50 at 12:00:00, and falls back to 0 at 23:59:59. At 00:00:00, the combined methods would produce an output that oscillates from 0 ((0 / 100) * (0 / 100) = 0) to 0 ((100 / 100) * (0 / 100) = 0) every 60 seconds, and gradually increase until at 12:00:00 the output would be oscillating from 0 ((0 / 100) * (50 / 100)) to 50 ((100 / 100) * (50 / 100)) every 60 seconds.

UART Device The UART device connected to the device. Baud Rate The baud rate of the UART device. I2C Address The I2C address of the device. I2C Bus The I2C bus the device is connected to. Output Mode The Output mode, if supported. Flow Rate The flow rate to dispense the volume (ml/min). Pulse Length This is the pulse length to transmit via 315/433 MHz. Default is 189 ms. Bit Length This is the bit length to transmit via 315/433 MHz. Default is 24-bit. Execute as User Select which user executes Linux Commands. On Command This is the command used to turn the output on. For wireless relays, this is the numerical command to be transmitted, and for command outputs this is the command to be executed. Commands may be for the linux terminal or Python 3 (depending on which output type selected). Off Command This is the command used to turn the output off. For wireless relays, this is the numerical command to be transmitted, and for command outputs this is the command to be executed. Commands may be for the linux terminal or Python 3 (depending on which output type selected). Force Command If an Output is already on, enabling this option will allow the On command to be executed rather than returning \"Output is already On\". PWM Command This is the command used to set the duty cycle. The string \"((duty_cycle))\" in the command will be replaced with the actual duty cycle before the command is executed. Ensure \"((duty_cycle))\" is included in your command for this feature to work correctly. Commands may be for the linux terminal or Python 3 (depending on which output type selected). Current Draw (amps) The is the amount of current the device powered by the output draws. Note: this value should be calculated based on the voltage set in the Energy Usage Settings . Startup State This specifies whether the output should be ON or OFF when mycodo initially starts. Some outputs have an additional options. Startup Value If the Startup State is set to User Set Value (such as for PWM Outputs), then this value will be set when Mycodo starts up. Shutdown State This specifies whether the output should be ON or OFF when mycodo initially shuts down. Some outputs have an additional options. Shutdown Value If the Shutdown State is set to User Set Value (such as for PWM Outputs), then this value will be set when Mycodo shuts down. Trigger at Startup Select to enable triggering Functions (such as Output Triggers) when Mycodo starts and if Start State is set to ON. Seconds to turn On This is a way to turn a output on for a specific duration of time. This can be useful for testing the outputs and powered devices or the measured effects a device may have on an environmental condition. On/Off (GPIO) ~ The On/Off (GPIO) output merely turns a GPIO pin High (3.3 volts) or Low (0 volts). This is useful for controlling things like electromechanical switches, such as relays, to turn electrical devices on and off. Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger voltage, without exposing the low-voltage system to the dangers of the higher voltage. Add and configure outputs in the Output tab. Outputs must be properly set up before they can be used in the rest of the system. To set up a wired relay, set the \"GPIO Pin\" (using BCM numbering) to the pin you would like to switch High (5 volts) and Low (0 volts), which can be used to activate relays and other devices. On Trigger should be set to the signal state (High or Low) that induces the device to turn on. For example, if your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 0-volts, set On Trigger to \"Low\", otherwise if your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 5 volts, set it to \"High\". Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) ~ Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique used to encode a message into a pulsing signal, at a specific frequency in Hertz (Hz). The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load. The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect the load (the device that uses the power), which is to say that the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible. The rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary greatly depending on load and application, for example Quote Switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove; 120 Hz in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies. The term duty cycle describes the proportion of 'on' time to the regular interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power, because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, with 0% being always off, 50% being off for half of the time and on for half of the time, and 100% being always on. Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Options ~ Setting Description Library Select the method for producing the PWM signal. Hardware pins can produce up to a 30 MHz PWM signal, while any other (non-hardware PWM) pin can produce up to a 40 kHz PWM signal. See the table, below, for the hardware pins on various Pi boards. Pin (GPIO) This is the GPIO pin that will output the PWM signal, using BCM numbering. Frequency (Hertz) This is frequency of the PWM signal. Invert Signal Send an inverted duty cycle to the output controller. Duty Cycle This is the proportion of the time on to the time off, expressed in percent (0 -100). Non-hardware PWM Pins ~ When using non-hardware PWM pins, there are only certain frequencies that can be used. These frequencies in Hertz are 40000, 20000, 10000, 8000, 5000, 4000, 2500, 2000, 1600, 1250, 1000, 800, 500, 400, 250, 200, 100, and 50 Hz. If you attempt to set a frequency that is not listed here, the nearest frequency from this list will be used. Hardware PWM Pins ~ The exact frequency may be set when using hardware PWM pins. The same PWM channel is available on multiple GPIO. The latest frequency and duty cycle setting will be used by all GPIO pins which share a PWM channel. BCM Pin PWM Channel Raspberry Pi Version 12 0 All models except A and B 13 1 All models except A and B 18 0 All models 19 1 All models except A and B 40 0 Compute module only 41 1 Compute module only 45 1 Compute module only 52 0 Compute module only 53 1 Compute module only Schematics for DC Fan Control ~ Below are hardware schematics that enable controlling direct current (DC) fans from the PWM output from Mycodo. PWM output controlling a 12-volt DC fan (such as a PC fan) Schematics for AC Modulation ~ Below are hardware schematics that enable the modulation of alternating current (AC) from the PWM output from Mycodo. PWM output modulating alternating current (AC) at 1% duty cycle PWM output modulating alternating current (AC) at 50% duty cycle PWM output modulating alternating current (AC) at 99% duty cycle Peristaltic Pump ~ There are two peristaltic pump Output modules that Mycodo supports, a generic peristaltic pump Output, and the Atlas Scientific EZO-PMP peristaltic pump. Generic Peristaltic Pump ~ Any peristaltic pump can be used with the Generic Peristaltic Pump Output to dispense liquids. The most basic dispensing abilities are to start dispensing, stop dispensing, or dispense for a duration of time. If the pump rate has been measured, this value can be entered into the Fastest Rate (ml/min) setting and the Output controller will then be able to dispense specific volumes rather than merely for durations of time. In oder to dispense specific volumes, the Output Mode will also need to be set in addition to the Desired Flow Rate (ml/min), if the Output Mode has been set to Specify Flow Rate. To determine your pump's flow rate, first purge all air from your pump's hose. Next, instruct the pump to dispense for 60 seconds and collect the liquid it dispenses. Once finished, measure the amount of liquid and enter this value, in milliliters into the Fastest Rate (ml/min) setting. Once your pump's flow rate is set, you can now start dispensing specific volumes rather than durations. This Output module relies on switching a GPIO pin High and Low to switch the peristaltic pump on and off. This is most easily accomplished with the use of a relay in-line with your pump's power supply or using the GPIO as an input signal directly to the pump (if supported). When using a relay, it's important to develop your circuit to provide the fastest possible switching of the pump. Since the volume dispensed by the pump is dependent on time, the faster the pump switching can occur, the more accurate the dispensing will be. Many peristaltic pumps operate on DC voltage and require an AC-DC converter. These converters can take a significant amount of time to energize once power is applied as well as de-energize once power is removed, causing significant delays that can impact dispensing accuracy. To alleviate this issue, the DC power should be switched, rather than the AC power, which will remove this potential delay. Atlas Scientific Peristaltic Pump ~ The Atlas Scientific peristaltic pump is a peristaltic pump and microcontroller combined that allows it to be communicated with via I2C or Serial and can accurately dispense specific volumes of fluid. There are several commands the pump can accept, including commands to calibrate, turn on, turn off, and dispense at a specific rate, among others. Atlas Scientific peristaltic pumps are good options, but are more expensive than generic peristaltic pumps. Peristaltic Pump Options ~ Setting Description Output Mode \"Fastest low Rate\" will pump liquid at the fastest rate the pump can perform. \"Specify Flow Rate\" will pump liquid at the rate set by the \"Flow Rate (ml/min)\" option. Flow Rate (ml/min) This is how fast liquid will be pumped if the \"Specify Flow Rate\" option is selected for the Output Mode option. Fastest Rate (ml/min) This is the rate at which the pump dispenses liquid, in ml/min. Minimum On (sec/min) This is the minimum duration (seconds) the pump should be turned on for every 60 second period of pumping. This option is only used when Specify Flow Rate is selected as the output Mode. Wireless 315/433 MHz ~ Certain 315/433 MHz wireless relays may be used, however you will need to set the pin of the transmitter (using BCM numbering), pulse length, bit length, protocol, on command, and off command. To determine your On and Off commands, connect a 315/433 MHz receiver to your Pi, then run the receiver script, below, replacing 17 with the pin your receiver is connected to (using BCM numbering), and press one of the buttons on your remote (either on or off) to detect the numeric code associated with that button. sudo ~/Mycodo/env/bin/python ~/Mycodo/mycodo/devices/wireless_rpi_rf.py -d 2 -g 17 433 MHz wireless relays have been successfully tested with SMAKN 433MHz RF Transmitters/Receivers and Etekcity Wireless Remote Control Electrical Outlets (see Issue 88 for more information). If you have a 315/433 MHz transmitter/receiver and a wireless relay that does not work with the current code, submit a new issue with details of your hardware. Linux Command ~ Another option for output control is to execute a terminal command when the output is turned on, off, or a duty cycle is set. Commands will be executed as the user 'root'. When a Linux Command output is created, example code is provided to demonstrate how to use the output. Python Command ~ The Python Command output operates similarly to the Linux Command output, however Python 3 code is being executed. When a Python Command output is created, example code is provided to demonstrate how to use the output. Output Notes ~ Wireless and Command (Linux/Python) Outputs: Since the wireless protocol only allows 1-way communication to 315/433 MHz devices, wireless relays are assumed to be off until they are turned on, and therefore will appear red (off) when added. If a wireless relay is turned off or on outside Mycodo (by a remote, for instance), Mycodo will *not * be able to determine the state of the relay and will indicate whichever state the relay was last. This is, if Mycodo turns the wireless relay on, and a remote is used to turn the relay off, Mycodo will still assume the relay is on.","title":"Outputs"},{"location":"Outputs/#custom-outputs","text":"There is a Custom Output import system in Mycodo that allows user-created Outputs to be created an used in the Mycodo system.

Your remote system needs to have an SSH server running and rsync installed. This system will need rsync installed and be able to access your remote system via SSH keyfile (login without a password). You can do this by creating an SSH key on this system running Mycodo with \"ssh-keygen\" (leave the password field empty), then run \"ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@REMOTE_HOST_IP\" to transfer your public SSH key to your remote system (changing pi and REMOTE_HOST_IP to the appropriate user and host of your remote system). You can test if this worked by trying to connect to your remote system with \"ssh pi@REMOTE_HOST_IP\" and you should log in without being asked for a password. Be careful not to set the Period too low, which could cause the function to begin running before the previous operation(s) complete. Therefore, it is recommended to set a relatively long Period (greater than 10 minutes). The default Period is 15 days.

That is, an output will be powered and the response measured from a sensor several times to calculate the P, I, and D gains. Updates about the operation will be sent to the Daemon log. If the autotune successfully completes, a summary will be sent to the Daemon log as well. Currently, only raising a Measurement is supported, but lowering should be possible with some modification to the function controller code. It is recommended to create a graph on a dashboard with the Measurement and Output to monitor that the Output is successfully raising the Measurement beyond the Setpoint. Note: Autotune is an experimental feature, it is not well-developed, and it has a high likelihood of failing to generate PID gains. Do not rely on it for accurately tuning your PID controller.

Your remote system needs to have an SSH server running and rsync installed. This system will need rsync installed and be able to access your remote system via SSH keyfile (login without a password). You can do this by creating an SSH key on this system running Mycodo with \"ssh-keygen\" (leave the password field empty), then run \"ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@REMOTE_HOST_IP\" to transfer your public SSH key to your remote system (changing pi and REMOTE_HOST_IP to the appropriate user and host of your remote system). You can test if this worked by trying to connect to your remote system with \"ssh pi@REMOTE_HOST_IP\" and you should log in without being asked for a password. Be careful not to set the Period too low, which could cause the function to begin running before the previous operation(s) complete. Therefore, it is recommended to set a relatively long Period (greater than 10 minutes). The default Period is 15 days. Note that the Period will reset if the system or the Mycodo daemon restarts and the Function will run, generating new settings and measurement archives that will be synced. There are two common ways to use this Function: 1) A short period (1 hour), only have Backup Camera Directories enabled, and use the Backup Settings Now and Backup Measurements Now buttons manually to perform a backup, and 2) A long period (15 days), only have Backup Settings and Backup Measurements enabled. You can even create two of these Functions with one set up to perform long-Period settings and measurement backups and the other set up to perform short-Period camera backups.","title":"Backup to Remote Host (rsync)"},{"location":"Supported-Functions/#options_2","text":"","title":"Options"},{"location":"Supported-Functions/#actions","text":"","title":"Actions"},{"location":"Supported-Functions/#bang-bang-hysteretic-onoff-raiselower","text":"A simple bang-bang control for controlling one output from one input.

It's a good idea to clear the calibration before calibrating. Always perform a dry calibration with the probe in the air (not in any fluid). Then perform either a one- or two-point calibration with calibrated solutions. If performing a one-point calibration, use the Single Point Calibration field and button. If performing a two-point calibration, use the Low and High Point Calibration fields and buttons. Allow a minute or two after submerging your probe in a calibration solution for the measurements to equilibrate before calibrating to that solution. The EZO EC circuit default temperature compensation is set to 25 \u00b0C. If the temperature of the calibration solution is +/- 2 \u00b0C from 25 \u00b0C, consider setting the temperature compensation first. Note that at no point should you change the temperature compensation value during calibration. Therefore, if you have previously enabled temperature compensation, allow at least one measurement to occur (to set the compensation value), then disable the temperature compensation measurement while you calibrate. ~ Clear Calibration ~ Type: Button Calibrate Dry ~ Type: Button Single Point EC (\u00b5S) ~ Type: Integer Default Value: 84 Description: The EC (\u00b5S) of the single point calibration solution Calibrate Single Point ~ Type: Button Low Point EC (\u00b5S) ~ Type: Integer Default Value: 12880 Description: The EC (\u00b5S) of the low point calibration solution Calibrate Low Point ~ Type: Button High Point EC (\u00b5S) ~ Type: Integer Default Value: 80000 Description: The EC (\u00b5S) of the high point calibration solution Calibrate High Point ~ Type: Button The I2C address can be changed.

It's a good idea to clear the calibration before calibrating. The first calibration must be the Mid point. The second must be the Low point. And the third must be the High point. You can perform a one-, two- or three-point calibration, but they must be performed in this order. Allow a minute or two after submerging your probe in a calibration solution for the measurements to equilibrate before calibrating to that solution. The EZO pH circuit default temperature compensation is set to 25 \u00b0C. If the temperature of the calibration solution is +/- 2 \u00b0C from 25 \u00b0C, consider setting the temperature compensation first.

Texas Instruments: ADS1256: Generic Analog pH/EC ~ Manufacturer: Texas Instruments Measurements: Ion Concentration/Electrical Conductivity Interfaces: UART Libraries: wiringpi, kizniche/PiPyADC-py3 Dependencies: wiringpi , pipyadc_py3 This input relies on an ADS1256 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to measure pH and/or electrical conductivity (EC) from analog sensors. You can enable or disable either measurement if you want to only connect a pH sensor or an EC sensor by selecting which measurements you want to under Measurements Enabled. Select which channel each sensor is connected to on the ADC. There are default calibration values initially set for the Input. There are also functions to allow you to easily calibrate your sensors with calibration solutions. If you use the Calibrate Slot actions, these values will be calculated and will replace the currently-set values. You can use the Clear Calibration action to delete the database values and return to using the default values. If you delete the Input or create a new Input to use your ADC/sensors with, you will need to recalibrate in order to store new calibration data.

Next, press Dispense Amount and the pump will be instructed to dispense 10 ml (unless you changed the default value). Measure how much fluid was actually dispensed, enter this value in the Actual Volume Dispensed (ml) field, and press Calibrate to Dispensed Amount. Now any further pump volumes dispensed should be accurate. ~ Clear Calibration ~ Type: Button Volume to Dispense (ml) ~ Type: Decimal Default Value: 10.0 Description: The volume (ml) that is instructed to be dispensed Dispense Amount ~ Type: Button Actual Volume Dispensed (ml) ~ Type: Decimal Default Value: 10.0 Description: The actual volume (ml) that was dispensed Calibrate to Dispensed Amount ~ Type: Button The I2C address can be changed.

Check the Upgrade Log for any issues that may have occurred. The log is located at /var/log/mycodo/mycodoupgrade.log but may also be accessed from the web UI (if you're able to): select [Gear Icon] -> Mycodo Logs -> Upgrade Log . Sometimes issues may not immediately present themselves. It is not uncommon to be experiencing a database issue that was actually introduced several Mycodo versions ago, before the latest upgrade. Because of the nature of how many versions the database can be in, correcting a database issue may be very difficult. It may be much easier to delete your database and let Mycodo generate a new one. Use the following commands to rename your database and restart the web UI. If both commands are successful, refresh your web UI page in your browser in order to generate a new database and create a new Admin user. mv ~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db ~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db.backup sudo service mycodoflask restart","title":"Incorrect Database Version"},{"location":"Troubleshooting/#more","text":"Check out the Diagnosing Mycodo Issues Wiki Page on github for more information about diagnosing issues.","title":"More"},{"location":"Upgrade-Backup-Restore/","text":"Upgrading ~ Page: [Gear Icon] -> Upgrade If you already have Mycodo installed, you can perform an upgrade to the latest Mycodo Release by either using the Upgrade option in the web interface (recommended) or by issuing the following command in a terminal.
