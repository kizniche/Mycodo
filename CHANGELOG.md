## 8.17.0 (Unreleased)

This release has several updates that allow Mycodo to be installed and run on Debian Trixie (13) and Raspberry Pi OS Trixie (13). These operating system versions use Python 3.11 by default. If you are using an older operating system, you may not be able to upgrade to this version if you don't have at least Python 3.11, or some Python packages may not be able to upgrade properly. If you are using an older operating system and older Python version, it is recommended to stay on your current version of Mycodo that is compatible with your OS.

If you are running Debian 12 or similar version operating system, you will need to install Python 3.11, regenerate your virtualenv, then install dependencies, before upgrading to this version.

See https://askubuntu.com/a/1438713 for instructions for installing Python 3.11 on Debian-based operating systems. Briefly:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install python3.11
```

Then regenerate the virtualenv and install dependencies:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /opt/Mycodo/env
virtualenv --python="/usr/bin/python3.11" /opt/Mycodo/env
/opt/Mycodo/env/bin/pip install -r /opt/Mycodo/requirements.txt
/opt/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_post.sh
```

Restart Mycodo daemon and frontend and ensure they still work:

```bash
sudo service mycodo restart
sudo service mycodoflask restart
```

This release introduces the ability to override MYCODO_DB_PATH, SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI, and ALEMBIC_URL in mycodo/config.py to use an alternate settings database. This is accomplished by creating these variables in mycodo/config_override.py. This new config file will be checked on startup and will persist after upgrades.

## 8.16.0 (2024.09.29)

This release updates several python packages that require Python >= 3.8. You can check your Python version prior to upgrading. If you do not have the required version, you should not upgrade, since this will likely break your system. To be able to use this and future Mycodo releases, ensure you are running an updated operating system that supports a modern Python version.

This release changes the Desktop grid width from 20 to 24, enabling the use of 3 column layouts that are evenly-spaced. You will need to resize/rearrange Dashboard Widgets after this update to correct for the new width. The update of Gridstack to 10.0.1 also now allows the ability to drag Desktop widgets on mobile devices. If you don't like this behavior, you should lock the desktop from the Dashboard Configuration menu to prevent widgets from being dragged/rearranged.

This release changes the install directory from ~/Mycodo to /opt/Mycodo. This necessitates deleting and regenerating the Python virtual environment. If you have any custom changes to the Mycodo venv, you will need to make those changes again after the upgrade. As a result of moving the install directory, following the upgrade, you will need to either run "sudo service mycodoflask restart" in a terminal or reboot your system for the web interface to become accessible again.

## 8.15.7 (2023-03-02)

This update fixes a few bugs and adds the new Input Equation Action, which can apply an equation to an Input measurements prior to being stored in the database. For instance, if you wanted to apply an offset of +10 to a particular measurement of an Input, you could use the equation "x+10".

In order for this new Action to be able to be created, there had to be a refactoring of the `trigger_action()` API function and `run_action()` Action module function.

All references your code previously made to:

`trigger_action(action_id, value=None, message='', debug=False)`

Will need to be changed to:

`trigger_action(action_id, value=None, debug=False)`

Additionally, custom Action modules previously with the Class function:

`run_action(self, message, dict_vars)`

Will need to be changed to:

`run_action(self, dict_vars)`

Since dict_vars will be a dictionary that contains the key "message". Any messages added in `run_action()` will need to be appended to `dict_vars['message']`. Additionally, dict_vars will need to be returned by `run_action()` rather than the variable messages.

Again, if you use any custom Actions, it is imperative that you make this second update to your modules for them to be able to properly work when upgrading to or beyond v8.15.7.

## 8.15.0 (2023-01-13)

This release fixes several bugs and changes how measurement timestamps are returned from the time-series database.

### InfluxDB Changes

Since support for InfluxDB 2.x was added, in order to make data that's returned from the time-series database more consistent, all timestamps from internal Mycodo functions will be returned as a decimal epoch value. Please update any custom modules or code to incorporate this change.

Previous behavior: InfluxDB 1.x returned data as a date/time string value (e.g. 2022-10-31T14:49:25.034447Z).

New Behavior: InfluxDB 1.x returned data as an epoch float value (e.g. 1667228575.557).

### Camera Changes

Cameras integration was initially built into the Mycodo system. This made it difficult for users to add new camera libraries or features unless they learned the codebase well enough to understand the many files needed to be modified. This release allows for camera functinality to be developed within a single Function module file. This enables users to more easily develop and implement their own Camera Functions or modify existing Camera Functions to add new features.

As this system is developed, the original camera system will be phased out, as it's a lot of work to maintain two different camera systems. As of now, there is only one Camera Function (libcamera). This should be considered EXPERIMENTAL and only used to test the development of this new feature until it is considered stable.

LCD and Math Controllers have been completely removed from Mycodo and replaced with Functions. If you were previously using an LCD or Math controller, you will need to add the corresponding Function and change any other parts of the system that referenced those devices.

If you have any custom Output modules, you will need to rename setup_output(self) to initialize(self) within the modules. If you don't use setup_output(self) and initialize(self) doesn't exist, you will need to create it in the module at a minimum with just pass:

```python
def initialize(self):
    pass
```

## 8.12.0 (2021-08-29)

This release changes the way settings are saved, which requires a change to any custom Inputs/Outputs/Functions you have in use. If your custom module includes the seldom-used execute_at_modification() function (such as Mycodo/mycodo/inputs/python_code.py), you will need to change the parameters as well as the return variables.

Before:

```python
def execute_at_modification(
        mod_entry,
        request_form,
        custom_options_dict_presave,
        custom_options_channels_dict_presave,
        custom_options_dict_postsave,
        custom_options_channels_dict_postsave):
    allow_saving = True  # Allows saving of options to occur
    return (allow_saving,
            mod_entry,
            custom_options_dict_postsave,
            custom_options_channels_dict_postsave)
```

After:

```python
def execute_at_modification(
        messages,
        mod_entry,
        request_form,
        custom_options_dict_presave,
        custom_options_channels_dict_presave,
        custom_options_dict_postsave,
        custom_options_channels_dict_postsave):
     # messages["page_refresh"] = True  # Setting to True will cause the options on the user's page to refresh
     # messages["error"].append("Some error")  # Uncomment this line to prevent options saving
     # messages["warning"].append("This will be a warning message")
     # messages["info"].append("This will be an info message")
     if not messages["error"]:
        messages["success"].append("Successfully completed execute_at_modification()")
     return (messages,
             mod_entry,
             custom_options_dict_postsave,
             custom_options_channels_dict_postsave)
```

Additionally, if you are currently using the MQTT JSON Input and your topics contain any special characters, you will need to enclose the topic in quotes (e.g. sensor-1 to "sensor-1").

## 8.10.0 (2021-04-24)

This release contains changes that requires modification to any Custom Functions you may have in use. In order for the new features to work for Custom Functions, it required the use of an abstract base function class (similarly to Inputs and Outputs). As a result, any Custom Functions that previously were formatted as such:

```python
from mycodo.controllers.base_controller import AbstractController

class CustomModule(AbstractController, threading.Thread):
    """
    Class to operate custom controller
    """
    def __init__(self, ready, unique_id, testing=False):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        super().__init__(ready, unique_id=unique_id, name=__name__)

        self.unique_id = unique_id
        self.log_level_debug = None

        # Set custom options
        custom_function = db_retrieve_table_daemon(
            CustomController, unique_id=unique_id)
        self.setup_custom_options(
            FUNCTION_INFORMATION['custom_options'], custom_function)
```

will need to be changed to the format:

```python
from mycodo.functions.base_function import AbstractFunction

class CustomModule(AbstractFunction):
    """
    Class to operate custom controller
    """
    def __init__(self, function, testing=False):
        super().__init__(function, testing=testing, name=__name__)

        # Note: The following 2 lines are no longer needed to be defined here. Delete them.
        # self.unique_id = function.unique_id  
        # self.log_level_debug = None

        # Set custom options
        custom_function = db_retrieve_table_daemon(
            CustomController, unique_id=self.unique_id)  # Note: "self." is added here
        self.setup_custom_options(
            FUNCTION_INFORMATION['custom_options'], custom_function)

        # These two lines are new and are required to execute initialize_variables()
        if not testing:
            self.initialize_variables()
```

You also no longer need to define the following (i.e. you can remove these lines):

```python
controller = db_retrieve_table_daemon(
    CustomController, unique_id=self.unique_id)
self.log_level_debug = controller.log_level_debug
self.set_log_level_debug(self.log_level_debug)
```

Additionally, if you have pre_stop() in your Function Class, it will need to be renamed to stop_function().

There are two ways to perform these changes.

Method A:

1. Deactivate all custom functions.
2. Delete all custom functions on the Setup -> Function page.
3. Delete all custom functions on the Configure -> Custom Functions page.
4. Perform the Mycodo upgrade.
5. Make the necessary edits to all your Custom Functions.
6. Import all your updated Custom Functions on the Configure -> Custom Functions page.
7. Add and configure your Custom Functions on the Setup -> Function page.

Method B:

1. Either SSH into your Raspberry Pi or use a keyboard/mouse/monitor and edit the Custom Functions in the ~/Mycodo/mycodo/function/custom_functions directory.
2. Perform the Mycodo upgrade.

Method A is more involved, but does not require accessing the Pi from outside the web UI. Method B has fewer steps and doesn't require deleting and reconfiguring new Functions, but requires being able to SSH in to your Raspberry Pi or connecting a keyboard/mouse/monitor to be able to edit the files in-place.

As always, a backup of the current system files and settings is performed during an upgrade, allowing you to restore your system to a previous release state if needed.

## 8.9.0 (2021-03-08)

This release contains bug fixes and several new types of Inputs and Outputs. These include stepper motors, digital-to-analog converters, a multi-channel PWM output, as well as an input to acquire current and future weather conditions.

This release also deprecates Math controllers. Current Math controllers will continue to function, but new Math controllers cannot be created. Instead, all Math controller functionality has been ported to Functions (Setup -> Function page), in order to reduce complexity and improve customizability. Much like Inputs and Outputs, Functions are single-file modules that can be created by users and imported. Take a look at the Mycodo/mycodo/functions directory for the built-in Function modules.

The new weather input acquires current and future weather conditions from openweathermap.org with either a city (200,000 to choose from) or latitude/longitude for a location and a time frame from the present up to 7 days in the future, with a resolution of days or hours. An API key to use the service is free and the measurements returned include temperature (including minimum and maximum if forecasting days in the future), humidity, dew point, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction. This can be useful for incorporating current or future weather conditions into your conditional controllers or other functions or calculations. For instance, you may prevent Mycodo from watering your outdoor plants if the forecasted temperature in the next 12 to 24 hours is below freezing. You may also want to be alerted by email if the forecasted weather conditions are extreme. Not everyone wants to set up a weather station, but might still want to have local outdoor measurements, so this input was made to bridge that gap.

## 8.7.1 (2020-08-10)

### Bugfixes

 - Remove copy of widget HTML files during upgrade


## 8.7.0 (2020-08-10)

This update includes the final refactoring of the output system to accommodate output modules that can operate multiple different types of output types. For instance, a peristaltic pump can be instructed to turn on for a duration or instructed to pump a volume. As a result of the output framework being modified to accommodate this, the duty_cycle parameter was removed from ```output_on_off()``` and ```output_on()``` functions of the ```DaemonControl``` class of mycodo_client.py. As a result, if you were previously using either of these function, you will need to add the parameter ```output_type='pwm'``` and change the ```duty_cycle``` parameter to ```amount```. For example, ```output_on(output_id, duty_cycle=50)``` would need to be changed to ```output_on(output_id, output_type='pwm', amount=50)```, and ```output_on_off(output_id, 'on', duty_cycle=50)``` to ```output_on_off(output_id, 'on', output_type='pwm', amount=50)```.

This update also adds the ability to import custom Widget modules. Much like custom Inputs, Outputs, and Functions, you can now create and import your own single-file Widget module that allow new widgets to be added to a dashboard.

## 8.6.1 (2020-07-22)

### Bugfixes

 - Fix Wireless 315/433 MHz Output module


## 8.6.0 (2020-07-22)

This update adds a Generic Peristaltic Pump Output to compliment the Atlas Scientific Peristaltic Pump Output. Generic peristaltic pumps are less expensive but often have acceptable dispensing accuracy. Once your pump's flow rate has been measured and this rate set in the Output options, your pump can be used to dispense specific volumes of liquid just like the Atlas Scientific pumps. This release also enables pumps to dispense for durations of time in addition to specific volumes (once calibrated). So, you can now operate a PID controller or other functions/controllers that instruct a pump to dispense for a duration in seconds or a volume in milliliters.

In this update, the Atlas Scientific Peristaltic Pump Output duration units have been changed form minutes to seconds, to align with other Outputs that use the second SI unit.

WARNING: As a result of how this new output operates, a potentially breaking change has been introduced. If you use any custom Output modules, you will need to add the parameter output_type=None to the output_switch() function of all of your custom Output module files. If you do not, the Mycodo daemon/backend will fail to start after upgrading to or beyond this version. It is advised to modify your custom Output modules prior to upgrading to ensure the daemon successfully starts after the upgrade. If you have not created or imported any custom Output modules, there is nothing that needs to be done.

For instance, I currently have Mycodo running on my 64-bit PC in Ubuntu 18.04. This is an experimental feature and is not yet recommended to be used in a production environment. See the [Docker README](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/blob/master/docker/README.md) for more information.

## 7.7.0 (2019.09.08)

This release changes how user-created Python code is executed. This affects Python Code Inputs and Conditional Functions. All effort was made to reformat user scripts during the upgrade process to adhere to the new formatting guidelines, however there are a few instances where scripts could not be updated properly and will need to be done manually by the user before they will work properly. After upgrading your system, ensure your code conforms to the following guidelines:

1. Conditional Functions
   * Use 4-space indentation (not 2-space, tab, or other)
   * Change measure() to self.measure()
   * Change measure_dict() to self.measure_dict()
   * Change run_action() to self.run_action()
   * Change run_all_actions() to self.run_all_actions()
   * Change message to self.message
2. Python Code Inputs
   * Use 4-space indentation (not 2-space, tab, or other)
   * Change store_measurement() to self.store_measurement()

## 7.0.0 (2018-12-08)

The Mycodo 7.0 introduces many redesigned systems, including measurements/units, conversions, conditionals, and more (see full list, below). The remnants of Conditionals have been moved to a new controller, called Triggers, which executes actions in response to event triggers (such as time-based events, Output changes, sunrises/sunsets, etc.). The new Conditional system incorporates a powerful way of developing complex conditional statements. See ([#493](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/493)) for more information. Since earlier versions are not compatible with 7.x, all 6.x users will have to perform a fresh install or delete their settings database. An option will be presented on the upgrade page to delete the database and perform an upgrade.

## 5.5.0 (2017-12-25)

Merry Christmas!

With the release of 5.5.0, Mycodo becomes modern by migrating from Python 2.7.9 to Python 3 (3.5.3 if on Raspbian Stretch, 3.4.2 if on Raspbian Jessie). This release also brings a big switch from apache2+mod_wsgi to nginx+gunicorn as the web server.

### Issues

***You may experience an error during the upgrade that doesn't allow it to complete***

***It will no longer be possible to restore pre-5.5.0 backups***

***All users will be logged out of the web UI during the upgrade***

***All Conditionals will be deactivated and need reconfiguring***

***OpenCV has been removed as a camera module***

If you rely on your system to work, it is highly recommended that you ***DO NOT UPGRADE***. Wait until your system is no longer performing critical tasks to upgrade, in order to allow yourself the ability to thoroughly test your particular configuration works as expected, and top perform a fresh install if the upgrade fails. Although most parts of the system have been tested to work, there is, as always, the potential for unforeseen issues (for instance, not every sensor that Mycodo supports has physically been tested). Read the following notes carefully to determine if you want to upgrade to 5.5.0 and newer versions.

#### Failure during the upgrade to >= 5.5.0

I found that occasionally the upgrade will spontaneously stop without an indication of the issue. I've seen it happen during an apt-get install and during a pip upgrade. It does not seem consistent, and there were no erorrs, therefore it wasn't able to be fixed. If you experience an error during the upgrade that doesn't allow the upgrade to complete, issue the following commands to attempt to resume and complete the upgrade. If that doesn't fix it, you may have to install Mycodo from scratch.

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_post.sh
```

#### No restoring of pre-5.5.0 backups

Restoring pre-5.5.0 backups will not work. This is due to the moving of the pip virtual environments during the restore, the post-5.5.0 (python3) virtualenv not being compatible with the pre-5.5.0 virtualenv (python2), and moving from the apache2 web server to nginx. If you absolutely need to restore a backup, it must be done manually. Create a new github issue to get asistance with this.

Also with this release, exporting and importing both the Mycodo settings database and InfluxDB measurement database has been added. These may be imported back into Mycodo at a later timer. Currently, the InfluxDB (measurement) database may be imported into any other version of Mycodo, and the Mycodo (settings) database may only be imported to the same version of Mycodo. Automatic upgrading or downgrading of the Mycodo database to allow cross-version compatibility will be included in a future release. For the meantime, if you need to restore Mycodo settings to a particular Mycodo version, you can do the following: download the tar.gz of the particular [Mycodo Release](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/releases) compatible with your database backup, extract, install normally, import the Mycodo settings database, then perform an upgrade of Mycodo to the latest release.

#### All users will be logged out during the upgrade

Another consequence of changing from Python 2 to 3 is current browser cookies will cause an error with the web user interface. Therefore, all users will be logged out after upgrading to >= 5.5.0. This will cause some strange behavior that may be misconstrued as a failed upgrade:
 
 1. The upgrade log will not update during the upgrade. Give the upgrade ample time to finish, or monitor the upgrade log from the command line.
 
 2. After the upgrade is successful, the upgrade log box on the Upgrade page will redirect to the login page. Do not log in through the log box, but rather refresh the entire page to be redirected to the login page.

#### All Conditionals will be deactivated

The Conditional code has been refactored to make them more modular. Because some conditionals will need to be reconfigured before they will operate corectly, all conditionals have been deactivated. Therefore, after the upgrade, reconfigure them appropriately, then reactivate. Additionally, conditionals (for all controllers) have been moved to a new 'Function' page.

#### OpenCV has been disabled

A Python 3 compatible binary version of opencv, whoch doesn't require an extremely long (hours) compiling process, is unfortunately unavailable. Therefore, if you know of a library or module that can successfully acquire an image from your webcam (you have tested to work), create a [new issue](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/new) with the details of how you acquired the image and we can determine if the method can be integrated into Mycddo.

## 4.1.9 (2017-01-27)

This update fixes two major bugs: Sometimes admin users not being created properly from the web UI and the daemon not being set to automatically start during install.

This update also fixes an even more severe bug affecting the database upgrade system. If you installed a system before this upgrade, you are probably affected. This release will display a message indicating if your database has an issue. Deleting ~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db and restarting the web server (or reboot) will regenerate the database.

If your daemon doesn't automatically start because you installed it with a botched previous version, issue the following commands to add it to systemctl's autostart:

***Important***: Make sure you rename 'user' below to your actual user where you installed Mycodo, and make sure the Mycodo install directory is correct and points to the correct mycodo.service file.

```
sudo service mycodo stop
sudo systemctl disable mycodo.service
sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/mycodo.service
sudo systemctl enable /home/user/Mycodo/install/mycodo.service
sudo service mycodo start
```

### Features
