## 4.1.8 (Unreleased)

Bugfixes:

  - Fix inability to show latest time-lapse image on the camera page (images are still being captured)

## 4.1.7 (2017-01-19)

This update fixes an error in the upgrade system, but it may mean that you cannot upgrade from the web interface (only for this version). If you cannot upgrade, execute the following command from the terminal to manually upgrade:

```sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_mycodo_release.sh upgrade```

Bugfixes:

  - Fix upgrade system (mycodo_wrapper). This may have broke the upgrade system (if so, use the manual method in the README)
  - Fix time-lapses not resuming after an upgrade
  - Fix calculation of total 1-month relay usage and cost
  - Fix (and modify) the logging behavior in modules
  - Fix K30 sensor module returning None as a measurement value
  - Fix gpiod being added to crontab during install from setup.sh ([#159](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/174))

## 4.1.6 (2017-01-17)

Features:

  - Add ability to export selected measurement data (in CSV format) from a date/time span

Bugfixes:

  - Fix issue with setup.sh when the version of wget<1.16 ([#159](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/173))
  - Fix error calculating rely usage when it's currently the billing day of the month

Miscellaneous:

  - Remove Sensor Logs (Tools/Sensor Logs). The addition of the measurement export feature in this release deprecates Sensor Logs. Note that by the very nature of how the Sensor Log controllers were designed, there was a high probability of missing measurements. The new measurement export feature ensures all measurements are exported.
  - Add more translatable text
  - Add password repeat input when creating new admin user

## 4.1.5 (2017-01-14)

Bugfixes:

  - Fix DHT11 sensor module not returning values ([#159](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/171))
  - Fix HTU21D sensor module not returning values ([#159](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/172))

## 4.1.4 (2017-01-13)
