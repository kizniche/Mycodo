Mycodo has been translated to several languages. By default, the language of the browser will determine which language is used, but may be overridden in the General Settings, on the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> General` page. If you find an issue and would like to correct a translation or would like to add another language, this can be done at [https://translate.kylegabriel.com](http://translate.kylegabriel.com:8080/engage/mycodo/).

Also check out the [Translations](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/wiki/Translations) section of the Wiki for details on working with translation files manually.
