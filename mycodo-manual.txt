ABOUT MYCODO


Mycodo is an automated monitoring and regulation system that was built
to run on the Raspberry Pi (versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3).

Originally developed for cultivating edible mushrooms, Mycodo has grown
to do much more, including growing plants, culturing microorganisms,
maintaining animal environments (laboratory honey bee apiary, young
mammal and snake egg incubation, aquariums, herptariums), fermenting and
curing tobacco, fermenting and aging foods (beer, cheese, tempeh),
cooking food (sous-vide), and more.

The system comprises a backend (daemon) and a frontend (web server). The
backend acquires measurements from sensors and devices, and coordinates
a diverse set of responses to those measurements, including the ability
to modulate outputs (relays, PWM, wireless outlets), regulate
environmental conditions with electrical devices under PID control
(steady regulation or changing over time), schedule timers, capture
photos and stream video, trigger actions when measurements meet certain
conditions (modulate relays, execute commands, notify by email, etc.),
and more. The frontend is a web interface that enables easy navigation
and configuration from any browser-enabled device.



BRIEF OVERVIEW


There are a number of different uses for Mycodo. Some users simply store
sensor measurements to monitor conditions remotely, others regulate the
environmental conditions of a physical space, while others capture
motion-activated or timelapse photography, and more.

Input controllers acquire measurements and store them in a time series
database. Measurements typically come from sensors, but may also be
configured to use the return value of linux or Python commands, or math
equations, making a very powerful system for acquiring and generating
data.

Output controllers produce changes to the general input/output (GPIO)
pins or may be configured to execute linux or Python commands, enabling
a large number of potential uses. There are a few different types of
outputs: simple switching of pins (HIGH/LOW), generating pulse-width
modulated (PWM) signals, switching 315/433 MHz wireless outlets, as well
as executing linux and Python commands. The most common output is using
a relay to switch electrical devices on and off.

When Inputs and Outputs are combined, PID controllers may be used to
create a feedback loop that uses the Output device to modulate an
environmental condition the Input measures. Certain Inputs may be
coupled with certain Outputs to create a variety of different control
and regulation applications. Beyond simple regulation, Methods may be
used to create changing setpoints over time, enabling such things as
thermal cyclers, reflow ovens, environmental simulation for terrariums,
food and beverage fermentation or curing, and cooking food (sous-vide),
to name a few.

Triggers can be set to activate events based on specific dates and times
or according to durations of time. Conditionals are used to activates
certain events based on the truth of custom user statements (e.g.
“Sensor1 > 23 and 10 < Sensor2 < 30”).



FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


_What should I do if I have an issue?_

First, read though this manual to make sure you understand how the
system works and you’re using the system properly. Also check out the
Mycodo Wiki. You may even want to look through recent GitHub Issues. If
you haven’t resolved your issue by this point, make a New GitHub Issue
describing the issue and attaching a sufficient amount of evidence
(screenshots, log files, etc.) to aid in diagnosing the issue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_How do I add an Input (like a sensor) to the system if it’s not
currently supported?_

Currently, adding an Input device that’s not currently supported can be
achieved by two different methods:

The first involves editing several internal Mycodo files. There has been
effort to make the addition process as simple as possible. See the
Adding Support for a New Input Wiki page for how to do this. All changes
will be lost during an upgrade, therefore it is suggested to make a
GitHub pull request with your changes to permanently integrate them into
Mycodo.

The second way to add an Input is to create a script that obtains and
returns a numerical value when executed in the linux system of the
Raspberry Pi. This script may be configured to be executed by a “Linux
Command” Input type. This will periodically execute the command and
store the returned value to the database for use with the rest of the
Mycodo system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_How do I set up simple regulation?_

Here is how I generally set up Mycodo to monitor and regulate:

1.  Determine what environmental condition you want to measure or
    regulate. Consider the devices that must be coupled to achieve this.
    For instance, temperature regulation require a temperature sensor as
    the input and an electric heater (or cooler) as the output.
2.  Determine what relays you will need to power your electric devices.
    The Raspberry Pi is capable of directly switching relays (using a
    3.3-volt signal). Remember to select a relay that can handle the
    load and doesn’t exceed the maximum current draw from the Raspberry
    Pi GPIO pins.
3.  See the Device Specific Information for information about what
    sensors are supported. Acquire sensor(s) and relay(s) and connect
    them to the Raspberry Pi according to the manufacturer’s
    instructions.
4.  On the Setup -> Data page, create a new input using the drop-down to
    select the correct sensor or input device. Configure the input with
    the correct communication pins and other options. Activate the input
    to begin recording measurements to the database.
5.  Go to the Live page to ensure there is recent data being acquired
    from the input.
6.  On the Setup -> Output page, add a relay and configure the GPIO pin
    that switches it, whether the relay switches On when the signal is
    HIGH or LOW, and what state (On or Off) to set the relay when Mycodo
    starts. A pulse-width modulated (PWM) output may also be used, among
    others.
7.  Test the relay by switching it On and Off or generating a PWM signal
    from the Setup -> Output page and make sure the device connected to
    the relay turns On when you select “On”, and Off when you select
    “Off”.
8.  On the Setup -> Function page, create a PID controller with the
    appropriate input, output, and other parameters. Activate the PID
    controller.
9.  On the Dash page, create a graph that includes the input
    measurement, the output that is being used by the PID, and the PID
    output and setpoint. This provides a good visualization for tuning
    the PID. See Quick Setup Examples for a greater detail of this
    process and tuning tips.

_Can I communicate with Mycodo from the command line?_

Yes, ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_client.py has this functionality, but
there’s a lot to be desired. Below may not be the most current list of
commands, so it’s recommended to execute the installed symlink
mycodo-client --help to see a full list with descriptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Can I variably-control the speed of motors or other devices with the
PWM output signal from the PID?_

Yes, as long as you have the proper hardware to do that. The PWM signal
being produced by the PID should be handled appropriately, whether by a
fast-switching solid state relay, an AC modulation circuit, DC
modulation circuit, or something else.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_I have a PID controller that uses one temperature sensor. If this
sensor stops working, my entire PID controller stops working. Is there a
way to prevent this by setting up a second sensor to be used in case the
first one fails?_

Yes, you can use as many sensors as you would like to create a redundant
system so your PID doesn’t stop working if one or more sensors fail. To
do this, follow the below instructions:

1.  Add and activate all your sensors. For this example, we will use
    three temperature sensors, Sensor1, Sensor2, and Sensor3, that
    return measurements in degrees Celsius.
2.  Go to the Setup -> Data page and add the Math controller
    “Redundancy”.
3.  In the options of the Redundancy controller, set the Period, Start
    Offset, and Max Age.
4.  In the options of the Redundancy controller, select Sensor1,
    Sensor2, and Sensor3 for the Input option and click Save.
5.  In the options of the Redundancy controller, change the order you
    wish to use the sensors under Order of Use. For this example, we
    will use the default order (Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3).
6.  In the options of the Redundancy controller, under Measurement
    Settings, select Celsius for the Measurement Unit and click Save
    under Measurement Settings.
7.  Activate the Redundancy Math controller.
8.  Go to the Live page and verify the Redundancy Math controller is
    working correctly by returning a value from one of the three
    selected Inputs. If the first sensor is working correctly, it should
    return this value. You can deactivate the first sensor (mimicking
    the first sensor stopped working) and see if the second sensor’s
    value is then returned.
9.  Go to the Setup -> Function page and select the new Redundancy Math
    controller for the PID Measurement option.

The PID controller will now use the measurement returned from the
Redundancy Math controller, which in turn will acquire its measurement
in the following way:

If a measurement can be found within the Max Age for Sensor1, the
measurement for Sensor1 will be returned. If a measurement from Sensor1
could not be acquired, and if a measurement can be found within the Max
Age for Sensor2, the measurement for Sensor2 will be returned. If a
measurement from Sensor2 could not be acquired, and if a measurement can
be found within the Max Age for Sensor3, the measurement for Sensor3
will be returned. If a measurement from Sensor3 could not be acquired,
then the Redundancy Math controller will not return a measurement at all
(indicating all three sensors are not working). It is advised to set up
a Conditional to send a notification email to yourself if one or more
measurements are unable to be acquired.

Data

Setup -> Data

Data are individual pieces of information stored for later use. They may
be values acquired from sensors, signals from analog-to-digital
controllers, a response from a command, or even math performed on other
data to produce an average, to name a few. Add, configure, and activate
Inputs to begin recording measurements to the database and allow them to
be used throughout Mycodo.

Input

Inputs, such as sensors, ADC signals, or even a response from a command,
enable measuring conditions in the environment or elsewhere, which will
be stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB). This database will
provide measurements for Graphs, LCDs, PID Controllers, Conditional
Statements, and other parts of Mycodo to operate from. Add, configure,
and activate inputs to begin recording measurements to the database and
allow them to be used throughout Mycodo.

In addition to several supported sensors and devices, a Linux command
may be specified that will be executed and the return value stored in
the measurement database to be used throughout the Mycodo system.

                          activation begins acquiring measurements from
                          the sensor. Any activated conditional statements
                          will now being operating.

  Deactivate              Deactivation stops measurements from being
                          acquired from the sensor. All associated
                          conditional statements will cease to operate.

  Save                    Save the current configuration entered into the
                          input boxes for a particular sensor.

                          displayed.

  Power Output            Select a output that powers the sensor. This
                          enables powering cycling (turn off then on) when
                          the sensor returns 3 consecutive errors to
                          attempt to fix the issue. Transistors may also
                          be used instead of a relay (note: NPN
                          transistors are preferred over PNP for powering
                          sensors).

  Location                Depending on what sensor is being used, you will
                          need to either select a serial number (DS18B20
                          temperature sensor), a GPIO pin (in the case of
                          sensors read by a GPIO), or an I2C address. or
                          other.

  I2C Bus                 The bus to be used to communicate with the I2C
                          address.

  Period (seconds)        After the sensor is successfully read and a
                          database entry is made, this is the duration of
                          time waited until the sensor is measured again.

  Measurement Unit        Select the unit to save the measurement as (only
                          available for select measurements).

  Pre Output              If you require a output to be activated before a
                          measurement is made (for instance, if you have a
                          pump that extracts air to a chamber where the
                          sensor resides), this is the output number that
                          will be activated. The output will be activated
                          for a duration defined by the Pre Duration, then
                          once the output turns off, a measurement by the
                          sensor is made.

  Pre Output Duration     This is the duration of time that the Pre Output
  (seconds)               runs for before the sensor measurement is
                          obtained.

  Pre Output During       If enabled, the Pre Output stays on during the
  Measurement             acquisition of a measurement. If disabled, the
                          Pre Output is turned off directly before
                          acquiring a measurement.

  Command                 A linux command (executed as the user ‘root’)
                          that the return value becomes the measurement

  Command Measurement     The measured condition (e.g. temperature,
                          humidity, etc.) from the linux command

  Command Units           The units of the measurement condition from the
                          linux command

  Edge                    Edge sensors only: Select whether the Rising or
                          Falling (or both) edges of a changing voltage
                          are detected. A number of devices to do this
                          when in-line with a circuit supplying a 3.3-volt
                          input signal to a GPIO, such as simple
                          mechanical switch, a button, a magnet
                          (reed/hall) sensor, a PIR motion detector, and
                          more.

  Bounce Time (ms)        Edge sensors only: This is the number of
                          milliseconds to bounce the input signal. This is
                          commonly called debouncing a signal [1] and may
                          be necessary if using a mechanical circuit.

  Reset Period (seconds)  Edge sensors only: This is the period of time
                          after an edge detection that another edge will
                          not be recorded. This enables devices such as
                          PIR motion sensors that may stay activated for
                          longer periods of time.

  Measurement             Analog-to-digital converter only: The type of
                          measurement being acquired by the ADC. For
                          instance, if the resistance of a photocell is
                          being measured through a voltage divider, this
                          measurement would be “light”.

  Units                   Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the
                          unit of the measurement. With the above example
                          of “light” as the measurement, the unit may be
                          “lux” or “intensity”.

  BT Adapter              The Bluetooth adapter to communicate with the
                          input.

  Clock Pin               The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the
                          Clock pin of the ADC

  CS Pin                  The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the
                          CS pin of the ADC

  MISO Pin                The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the
                          MISO pin of the ADC

  MOSI Pin                The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the
                          MOSI pin of the ADC

  RTD Probe Type          Select to measure from a PT100 or PT1000 probe.

  Resistor Reference      If your reference resistor is not the default
  (Ohm)                   (400 Ohm for PT100, 4000 Ohm for PT1000), you
                          can manually set this value. Several
                          manufacturers now use 430 Ohm resistors on their
                          circuit boards, therefore it’s recommended to
                          verify the accuracy of your measurements and
                          adjust this value if necessary.

  Channel                 Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the
                          channel to obtain the voltage measurement from
                          the ADC.

  Gain                    Analog-to-digital converter only: set the gain
                          when acquiring the measurement.

  Sample Speed            Analog-to-digital converter only: set the sample
                          speed (typically samples per second).

  Volts Min               Analog-to-digital converter only: What is the
                          minimum voltage to use when scaling to produce
                          the unit value for the database. For instance,
                          if your ADC is not expected to measure below 0.2
                          volts for your particular circuit, set this to
                          “0.2”.

  Volts Max               Analog-to-digital converter only: This is
                          similar to the Min option above, however it is
                          setting the ceiling to the voltage range. Units
                          Min Analog-to-digital converter only: This value
                          will be the lower value of a range that will use
                          the Min and Max Voltages, above, to produce a
                          unit output. For instance, if your voltage range
                          is 0.0 - 1.0 volts, and the unit range is 1 -
                          60, and a voltage of 0.5 is measured, in
                          addition to 0.5 being stored in the database, 30
                          will be stored as well. This enables creating
                          calibrated scales to use with your particular
                          circuit.

  Units Max               Analog-to-digital converter only: This is
                          similar to the Min option above, however it is
                          setting the ceiling to the unit range.

  Weighting               The This is a number between 0 and 1 and
                          indicates how much the old reading affects the
                          new reading. It defaults to 0 which means the
                          old reading has no effect. This may be used to
                          smooth the data.

  Pulses Per Rev          The number of pulses for a complete revolution.

  Port                    The server port to be queried (Server Port Open
                          input).

  Times to Check          The number of times to attempt to ping a server
                          (Server Ping input).

  Deadline (seconds)      The maximum amount of time to wait for each ping
                          attempt, after which 0 (offline) will be
                          returned (Server Ping input).

  Type                          Description
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  Average (Multiple             Stores the statistical mean of multiple
  Measurements)                 selected measurements.

  Average (Single Measurement)  Stores the statistical mean of one
                                selected measurement over a duration of
                                time determined by the Max Age (seconds)
                                option.

  Difference                    Stores the mathematical difference
                                (value_1 -value_2).

  Equation                      Stores the calculated value of an
                                equation.

  Redundancy                    Select multiple Inputs and if one input
                                isn’t available, the next measurement will
                                be used. For example, this is useful if an
                                Input stops but you don’t want a PID
                                controller to stop working if there is
                                another measurement that can be used. More
                                than one Input can be and the preferred
                                Order of Use can be defined.

  Verification                  Ensures the greatest difference between
                                any selected Inputs is less than Max
                                Difference, and if so, stores the average
                                of the selected measurements.

  Median                        Stores the statistical median from the
                                selected measurements.

  Maximum                       Stores the largest measurement from the

  Minimum                       Stores the smallest measurement from the
                                selected measurements.

  Humidity                      Calculates and stores the percent relative
                                humidity from the dry-bulb and wet-bulb
                                temperatures, and optional pressure.

  Setting                    Description
  -------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  Input                      Select the Inputs to use with the particular Math
                             controller

  Period (seconds)           The duration of time between calculating and storing a
                             new value

  Max Age (seconds)          The maximum allowed age of the Input measurements. If
                             an Input measurement is older than this period, the
                             calculation is cancelled and the new value is not
                             stored in the database. Consequently, if another
                             controller has a Max Age set and cannot retrieve a
                             current Math value, it will cease functioning. A PID
                             controller, for instance, may stop regulating if there
                             is no new Math value created, preventing the PID
                             controller from continuing to run when it should not.

  Start Offset (seconds)     Wait this duration before attempting the first
                             calculation/measurement.

  Measurement                This is the condition being measured. For instance, if
                             all of the selected measurements are temperature, this
                             should also be temperature. A list of the pre-defined
                             measurements that may be used is below.

  Units                      This is the units to display along with the
                             measurement, on Graphs. If a pre-defined measurement
                             is used, this field will default to the units
                             associated with that measurement.

  Reverse Equation           For Difference calculations, this will reverse the
                             equation order, from value_1 - value_2 to
                             value_2 - value_1.

  Absolute Value             For Difference calculations, this will yield an
                             absolute value (positive number).

  Max Difference             If the difference between any selected Input is
                             greater than this value, no new value will be stored
                             in the database.

  Dry-Bulb Temperature       The measurement that will serve as the dry-bulb
                             temperature (this is the warmer of the two temperature
                             measurements)

  Wet-Bulb Temperature       The measurement that will serve as the wet-bulb
                             temperature (this is the colder of the two temperature
                             measurements)

  Pressure                   This is an optional pressure measurement that can be
                             used to calculate the percent relative humidity. If
                             disabled, a default 101325 Pa will be used in the
                             calculation.

  Equation                   An equation that will be solved with Python’s eval()
                             function. Let “x” represent the input value. Valid
                             equation symbols include: + - * / ^

  Order of Use               This is the order in which the selected Inputs will be
                             used. This must be a comma separated list of Input IDs
                             (integers, not UUIDs).

Output

Setup -> Output

Outputs are various signals that can be generated that operate devices.
An output can be a PWM signal, a simple HIGH/LOW signal to operate a
relay, a 315/433 MHz signal to switch a radio frequency-operated relay,
driving of pumps and motors, or an execution of a linux or Python
command, to name a few.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Pin                     This is the GPIO that will be the signal to the
                          output, using BCM numbering.

  WiringPi Pin            This is the GPIO that will be the signal to the
                          output, using WiringPi numbering.

  On State                This is the state of the GPIO to signal the
                          output to turn the device on. HIGH will send a
                          3.3-volt signal and LOW will send a 0-volt
                          signal. If you output completes the circuit (and
                          the device powers on) when a 3.3-volt signal is
                          sent, then set this to HIGH. If the device
                          powers when a 0-volt signal is sent, set this to
                          LOW.

  Protocol                This is the protocol to use to transmit via
                          315/433 MHz. Default is 1, but if this doesn’t
                          work, increment the number.

  UART Device             The UART device connected to the device.

  Baud Rate               The baud rate of the UART device.

  I2C Address             The I2C address of the device.

  I2C Bus                 The I2C bus the device is connected to.

  Flow Rate               The flow rate to dispense the volume (ml/min).

  Pulse Length            This is the pulse length to transmit via 315/433
                          MHz. Default is 189 ms.

  Bit Length              This is the bit length to transmit via 315/433
                          MHz. Default is 24-bit.

  On Command              This is the command used to turn the output on.
                          For wireless relays, this is the numerical
                          command to be transmitted, and for command
                          outputs this is the command to be executed.
                          Commands may be for the linux terminal or Python
                          3 (depending on which output type selected).

  Off Command             This is the command used to turn the output off.

  PWM Command             This is the command used to set the duty cycle.
                          The string “((duty_cycle))” in the command will
                          be replaced with the actual duty cycle before
                          the command is executed. Ensure “((duty_cycle))”
                          is included in your command for this feature to
                          work correctly. Commands may be for the linux
                          terminal or Python 3 (depending on which output
                          type selected).

  Current Draw (amps)     The is the amount of current the device powered
                          by the output draws. Note: this value should be
                          calculated based on the voltage set in the
                          Energy Usage Settings.

  Startup State           This specifies whether the output should be ON
                          or OFF when mycodo initially starts. Some
                          outputs have an additional option ‘Neither’
                          which will not issue an on or off command when
                          Mycodo starts or stops.

  Shutdown State          This specifies whether the output should be ON
                          or OFF when mycodo initially shuts down. Some
                          outputs have an additional option ‘Neither’
                          which will not issue an on or off command when
                          Mycodo starts or stops.

  Trigger at Startup      Select to enable triggering Functions (such as
                          Output Triggers) when Mycodo starts and if Start
                          State is set to ON.

  Seconds to turn On      This is a way to turn a output on for a specific
                          duration of time. This can be useful for testing
                          the outputs and powered devices or the measured
                          effects a device may have on an environmental
                          condition.

PWM

Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique used to encode a
message into a pulsing signal, at a specific frequency in Hertz (Hz).
The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled
by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate.
The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the
total power supplied to the load.

The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect
the load (the device that uses the power), which is to say that the
resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible.
The rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary
greatly depending on load and application, for example

  Switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove;
  120 Hz in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz
  for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio
  amplifiers and computer power supplies.

The term duty cycle describes the proportion of ‘on’ time to the regular
interval or ‘period’ of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power,
because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed
in percent, 100% being fully on.

PWM pins can be set up on the Setup -> Output` page, then it may be used
by a PWM PID Controller.

                          Hardware pins can produce up to a 30 MHz PWM
                          signal, while any other (non-hardware PWM) pin
                          can produce up to a 40 kHz PWM signal. See the
                          table, below, for the hardware pins on various
                          Pi boards.

Non-hardware PWM Pins

When using non-hardware PWM pins, there are only certain frequencies
that can be used. These frequencies in Hertz are 40000, 20000, 10000,
8000, 5000, 4000, 2500, 2000, 1600, 1250, 1000, 800, 500, 400, 250, 200,
100, and 50 Hz. If you attempt to set a frequency that is not listed
here, the nearest frequency from this list will be used.

Hardware PWM Pins

The exact frequency may be set when using hardware PWM pins. The same
PWM channel is available on multiple GPIO. The latest frequency and duty
cycle setting will be used by all GPIO pins which share a PWM channel.

Relays

Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small
voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger
voltage, without exposing the low-voltage system to the dangers of the
higher voltage.

Add and configure outputs in the Output tab. Outputs must be properly
set up before PID regulation can be achieved.

Wired

To set up a wired relay, set the “GPIO Pin” to the BCM GPIO number of
each pin that activates each relay. _On Trigger_ should be set to the
signal that activates the relay (the device attached to the relay turns
on). If your relay activates when the potential across the coil is
0-volts, set _On Trigger_ to “Low”, otherwise if your relay activates
when the potential across the coil is 3.3-volts (or whatever switching
voltage you are using, if not being driven by the GPIO pin), set it to
“High”.

Wireless

Certain 315/433 MHz wireless relays may be used, however you will need
to set the pin of the transmitter (using BCM numbering), pulse length,
bit length, protocol, on command, and off command. To determine your On
and Off commands, connect a 315/433 MHz receiver to your Pi, then run
the receiver script, below, replacing 17 with the pin your receiver is
connected to (using BCM numbering), and press one of the buttons on your
remote (either on or off) to detect the numeric code associated with
that button.

    sudo ~/Mycodo/env/bin/python ~/Mycodo/mycodo/devices/wireless_rpi_rf.py -d 2 -g 17

433 MHz wireless relays have been successfully tested with SMAKN 433MHz
RF Transmitters/Receivers and Etekcity Wireless Remote Control
Electrical Outlets (see Issue 88 for more information). If you have a
315/433 MHz transmitter/receiver and a wireless relay that does not work
with the current code, submit a new issue with details of your hardware.

Command

Another option for output control is to execute a terminal command when
the output is turned on, off, or a duty cycle. Commands will be executed
as the user ‘root’.

Wireless and Command Output Note: Since the wireless protocol only
allows 1-way communication to 315/433 MHz devices, wireless relays are
assumed to be off until they are turned on, and therefore will appear
red (off) when added. If a wireless relay is turned off or on outside
Mycodo (by a remote, for instance), Mycodo will _NOT_ be able to
determine the state of the relay and will indicate whichever state the
relay was last. This is, if Mycodo turns the wireless relay on, and a
remote is used to turn the relay off, Mycodo will still assume the relay
is on.

Pumps

Currently, only one pump is supported, the Atlas Scientific EZO-PMP
peristaltic pump.


Function

Setup -> Function

Functions couple Inputs with Outputs to perform specific tasks. For
example, this could be regulation of temperature with a temperature
sensor and heater with a PID Controller.

PID Controller

A proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller is a control loop
feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It
efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a
desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and
oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint
quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little
oscillation.

PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new
settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the
controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller
resumes operation.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                    Description
  -------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  Activate/Deactivate        Turn a particular PID controller on or off.

  Pause                      When paused, the control variable will not be updated
                             and the PID will not turn on the associated outputs.
                             Settings can be changed without losing current PID
                             output values.

  Hold                       When held, the control variable will not be updated
                             but the PID will turn on the associated outputs,
                             Settings can be changed without losing current PID
                             output values.

  Resume                     Resume a PID controller from being held or paused.

  Direction                  This is the direction that you wish to regulate. For
                             example, if you only require the temperature to be
                             raised, set this to “Up,” but if you require
                             regulation up and down, set this to “Both.”

  Period                     This is the duration between when the PID acquires a
                             measurement, the PID is updated, and the output is
                             modulated.

  Start Offset (seconds)     Wait this duration before attempting the first
                             calculation/measurement.

  Max Age                    The time (in seconds) that the sensor measurement age
                             is required to be less than. If the measurement is not
                             younger than this age, the measurement is thrown out
                             and the PID will not actuate the output. This is a
                             safety measure to ensure the PID is only using recent
                             measurements.

  Setpoint                   This is the specific point you would like the
                             environment to be regulated at. For example, if you
                             would like the humidity regulated to 60%, enter 60.

  Band (+/- Setpoint)        Hysteresis option. If set to a non-0 value, the
                             setpoint will become a band, which will be between the
                             band_max=setpoint+band and band_min=setpoint-band. If
                             Raising, the PID will raise above band_max, then wait
                             until the condition falls below band_min to resume
                             regulation. If Lowering, the PID will lower below
                             band_min, then wait until the condition rises above
                             band_max to resume regulating. If set to Both,
                             regulation will only occur to the outside min and max
                             of the band, and cease when within the band. Set to 0
                             to disable Hysteresis.

  Store Lower as Negative    Checking this will store all output variables (PID and
                             output duration/duty cycle) as a negative values in
                             the measurement database. This is useful for
                             displaying graphs that indicate whether the PID is
                             currently lowering or raising. Disable this if you
                             desire all positive values to be stored in the
                             measurement database.

  KP Gain                    Proportional coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for
                             present values of the error. For example, if the error
                             is large and positive, the control output will also be
                             large and positive.

  KI Gain                    Integral coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for past
                             values of the error. For example, if the current
                             output is not sufficiently strong, the integral of the
                             error will accumulate over time, and the controller
                             will respond by applying a stronger action.

  KD Gain                    Derivative coefficient (non-negative). Accounts for
                             predicted future values of the error, based on its
                             current rate of change.

  Integrator Min             The minimum allowed integrator value, for calculating
                             Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki * integrator; and PID output
                             = Kp_total + Ki_total + Kd_total)

  Integrator Max             The maximum allowed integrator value, for calculating
                             Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki * integrator; and PID output
                             = Kp_total + Ki_total + Kd_total)

  Output (Raise)             This is the output that will cause the particular
                             environmental condition to rise. In the case of
                             raising the temperature, this may be a heating pad or
                             coil.

  Min Duration (raise)       This is the minimum that the PID output must be before
                             the Up Output turns on. If the PID output exceeds this
                             minimum, the Up Output will turn on for the PID output
                             number of seconds.

  Max Duration (raise)       This is the maximum duration the Up Output is allowed
                             to turn on for. If the PID output exceeds this number,
                             the Up Output will turn on for no greater than this
                             duration of time.

  Output (Lower)             This is the output that will cause the particular
                             environmental condition to lower. In the case of
                             lowering the CO2, this may be an exhaust fan.

  Min Duration (lower)       This is the minimum that the PID output must be before
                             the Down Output turns on. If the PID output exceeds
                             this minimum, the Down Output will turn on for the PID
                             output number of seconds.

  Max Duration (lower)       This is the maximum duration the Down Output is
                             allowed to turn on for. if the PID output exceeds this
                             number, the Down Output will turn on for no greater
                             than this duration of time.

  Setpoint Tracking Method   Set a method to change the setpoint over time.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PID Autotune

The Autotune feature is useful for determining appropriate Kp, Ki, and
Kd gains of a PID controller. The autotuner will manipulate an output
and measure the response in the environment being measured by a sensor.
It will take several cycles to determine the gains according to several
rules. In order to use this feature, the PID controller must be properly
configured, and a Noise Band and Outstep selected, then select “Start
Autotune”. The output of the autotuner will appear in the daemon log
(Config -> Mycodo Logs -> Daemon). While the autotune is being
performed, it is recommended to create a graph that includes the Input,
Output, and PID Setpoint/Output in order to see what the PID Autotuner
is doing and to notice any issues. If your autotune is taking a long
time to complete, there may not be enough stability in the system being
manipulated to calculate a reliable set of PID gains. This may be
because there are too many disturbances to the system, or conditions are
changing too rapidly to acquire consistent measurement oscillations. If
this is the case, try modifying your system to reduce disturbances. Once
the autotune successfully completes, disturbances may be reintroduced in
order to further tune the PID controller to handle them.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Noise Band              This is the amount above the setpoint the
                          measured condition must reach before the output
                          turns off. This is also how much below the
                          setpoint the measured condition must fall before
                          the output turns back on.

  Outstep                 This is how many seconds the output will turn on
                          every PID Period. For instance, to autotune with
                          50% power, ensure the Outstep is half the value
                          of the PID Period.

Conditional

Conditional controllers are used to perform certain actions based on
whether a conditional statement is true, which is typically based on a
measurement or GPIO state.

Conditional Setup Guide

Python 3 is the environment that these conditionals will be executed.
The following

  Function                Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  measure(“{ID}”)         Returns a measurement for the Condition with ID.
  run_action(“{ID}”)      Executes the Action with ID.
  run_all_actions()       Executes all actions.

Since the Python code contained in the Conditional Statement must be
formatted properly, it’s best to familiarize yourself with the basics of
Python.

Note that there are two different IDs in use here, one set of IDs are
for the measurements, under the Conditions section of the Conditional,
and one set of IDs are for the Actions, under the Actions section of the
Conditional. Read all of this section, including the examples, below, to
fully understand how to configure a conditional properly.

IMPORTANT: If a measurement hasn’t been acquired within the Max Age that
is set, “None” will be returned when measure(“{ID}”) is called in the
code. It is very important that you account for this. All examples below
incorporate a test for the measurement being None, and this should not
be removed. If an error occurs (such as if the statement resolves to
comparing None to a numerical value, such as “if None < 23”), then the
code will stop there and an error will be logged in the daemon log.
Accounting for None is useful for determining if an Input is no longer
acquiring measurements (e.g. dead sensor, malfunction, etc.).

To create a basic conditional, follow these steps, using the numbers in
the screenshots, below, that correspond to the numbers in parentheses:

-   Navigate to the Setup -> Function page.
-   Select “Controller: Conditional”, then click Add.
-   Under Conditions (1), select a condition option, then click
    Add Condition.
-   Configure the newly-added Condition then click Save.
-   Under Actions (2), select an action option, then click Add Action.
-   Configure the newly-added Action then click Save.
-   Notice that each Condition and each Action has its own ID
    (underlined).
-   The default Conditional Statement (3) contains placeholder IDs that
    need to be changed to your Condition and Action IDs. Change the ID
    in measure(“{asdf1234}”) to your Condition ID. Change the ID in
    run_action(“{qwer5678}”, message=message) to your Action ID. Click
    Save at the top of the Conditional.
-   The logic used in the Conditional Statement will need to be adjusted
    to suit your particular needs. Additionally, you may add more
    Conditions or Actions. See the
    Advanced Conditional Statement examples, below, for usage examples.

If your Conditional Statement has been formatted correctly, your
Conditional will save and it will be ready to activate. If an error is
returned, your options will not have been saved. Inspect the error for
which line is causing the issue and read the error message itself to try
to understand what the problem is and how to fix it. There are an
unfathomable number of ways to configure a Conditional, but this should
hopefully get you started to developing one that suits your needs.

Note: Mycodo is constantly changing, so the screenshots below may not
match what you see exactly. Be sure to read this entire section of the
manual to understand how to use Conditionals.

[Figure-Mycodo-Conditional-Setup]

Simple Conditional Statement examples:

Each measure(“{ID}”) will return the most recent measurement obtained
from that particular measurement under the Conditions section of the
Conditional, as long as it’s within the set Max Age.

    # Example 1, no measurement, useful to notify by email when an Input stops working
    if measure("{asdf1234}") is None:
        run_all_actions()

    # Example 2, test two measurements
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
            run_all_actions()

    # Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        sum = measure_1 + measure_2
        if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum < 30.5:
            run_all_actions()

    # Example 4, combine into one conditional
    measurement = measure("{asdf1234}")
    if measurement != None and 20 < measurement < 30:
        run_all_actions()

    # Example 5, test two measurements and convert Edge Input from 0 or 1 to True or False
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if bool(measure_1) and measure_2 > 10:
            run_all_actions()

    # Example 6, test measurement with "or" and a rounded measurement
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 > 20 or int(round(measure_2)) in [20, 21, 22]:
            run_all_actions()

Advanced Conditional Statement examples:

These examples expand on the simple examples, above, by activating
specific actions. The following examples will reference actions with IDs
that can be found under the Actions section of the Conditional. Two
example action ID will be used: “qwer1234” and “uiop5678”. Additionally,
run_all_actions() is used here, which will run all actions in the order
in which they appear in the Actions section of the Conditional.

    # Example 1
    measurement = measure("{asdf1234}")
    if measurement is None:
        run_action("{qwer1234}")
    elif measurement > 23:
        run_action("{uiop5678}")
    else:
        run_all_actions()

    # Example 2, test two measurements
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
            run_action("{qwer1234}")
            run_action("{uiop5678}")

    # Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        sum = measure_1 + measure_2
        if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum < 30.5:
            run_action("{qwer1234}")
        else:
            run_action("{uiop5678}")

    # Example 4, combine into one conditional
    measurement = measure("{asdf1234}")
    if measurement != None and 20 < measurement < 30:
        run_action("{uiop5678}")

    # Example 5, test two measurements and convert Edge Input from 0 or 1 to True or False
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if bool(measure_1) and measure_2 > 10:
            run_all_actions()

    # Example 6, test measurement with "or" and a rounded measurement
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 > 20 or int(round(measure_2)) in [20, 21, 22]:
            run_action("{qwer1234}")
            if measure_1 > 30:
                run_action("{uiop5678}")

If your action is a type that receives a message (E-Mail or Note), you
can modify this message to include extra information before it is added
to the Note or E-Mail. To do this, append a string to the variable
message and add this to the message parameter of run_action() or
run_all_actions(). Below are some examples. Note the use of “+=” instead
of “=”, which appends the string to the variable message.

    # Example 1
    measurement = measure("{asdf1234}")
    if measurement is None and measurement > 23:
        message += "Measurement was {}".format(measurement)
        run_action("{uiop5678}", message=message)

    # Example 2
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
            message += "Measurement 1: {m1}, Measurement 2: {m2}".format(m1=measure_1, m2=measure_2)
            run_all_actions(message=message)

Before activating any conditionals, it’s advised to thoroughly explore
all possible scenarios and plan a configuration that eliminates
conflicts. Some devices or outputs may respond atypically or fail when
switched on and off in rapid succession. Therefore, trial run your
configuration before connecting devices to any outputs.

Conditional Options

Check if the latest measurement is above or below the set value.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Conditional Statement   The text string that includes device IDs
                          enclosed in curly brackets ({}) that will be
                          converted to the actual measurement before being
                          evaluated by python to determine if it is True
                          or False. If True, the associated actions will
                          be executed.

  Period (seconds)        The period (seconds) between conditional checks.

  Refractory Period       The minimum duration (seconds) to wait after a
  (seconds)               conditional has been triggered to begin
                          evaluating the conditional again.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conditional Condition Options

Conditional Conditions are variables that can be used within the
Conditional Statement.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Condition               Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Measurement             Acquires the latest measurement from an Input or
                          device. Set Max Age (seconds) to restrict how
                          long to accept values. If the latest value is
                          older than this duration, “None” is returned.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timer (Daily Time Span) Options

Run a timer that triggers Conditional Actions at a specific period if
it’s between the set start and end times. For example, if the Start Time
is set to 10:00 and End Time set to 11:00 and Period set to 120 seconds,
the Conditional Actions will trigger every 120 seconds when the time is
between 10 AM and 11 AM.

This may be useful, for instance, if you desire an Output to remain on
during a particular time period and you want to prevent power outages
from interrupting the cycle (which a simple Time Point Timer could not
prevent against because it only triggers once at the Start Time). By
setting an Output to turn the lights on every few minutes during the
Start -> End period, it ensured the Output remains on during this
period.

Methods

Setup -> Method

Methods enable Setpoint Tracking in PIDs and time-based duty cycle
changes in timers. Normally, a PID controller will regulate an
environmental condition to a specific setpoint. If you would like the
setpoint to change over time, this is called setpoint tracking. Setpoint
Tracking is useful for applications such as reflow ovens, thermal
cyclers (DNA replication), mimicking natural daily cycles, and more.
Methods may also be used to change a duty cycle over time when used with
a Run PWM Method Conditional.

Universal Options

These options are shared with several method types.

  Setting            Description
  ------------------ -----------------------------------------------------
  Start Time/Date    This is the start time of a range of time.
  End Time/Date      This is the end time of a range of time.
  Start Setpoint     This is the start setpoint of a range of setpoints.
  End Setpoint       This is the end setpoint of a range of setpoints.

Specific Method Options

Time/Date Method

A time/date method allows a specific time/date span to dictate the
setpoint. This is useful for long-running methods, that may take place
over the period of days, weeks, or months.

Duration Method

A Duration Method allows a _SETPOINT_ (for PIDs) or _DUTY CYCLE_ (for
Conditional) to be set after specific durations of time. Each new
duration added will stack, meaning it will come after the previous
duration, meaning a newly-added _START SETPOINT_ will begin after the
previous entry’s _END SETPOINT_.

If the “Repeat Method” option is used, this will cause the method to
repeat once it has reached the end. If this option is used, no more
durations may be added to the method. If the repeat option is deleted
then more durations may be added. For instance, if your method is 200
seconds total, if the Repeat Duration is set to 600 seconds, the method
will repeat 3 times and then automatically turn off the PID or
Conditional.

Daily (Time-Based) Method

The daily time-based method is similar to the time/date method, however
it will repeat every day. Therefore, it is essential that only the span
of one day be set in this method. Begin with the start time at 00:00:00
and end at 23:59:59 (or 00:00:00, which would be 24 hours from the
start). The start time must be equal or greater than the previous end
time.

Daily (Sine Wave) Method

The daily sine wave method defines the setpoint over the day based on a
sinusoidal wave. The sine wave is defined by y = [A * sin(B * x + C)] +
D, where A is amplitude, B is frequency, C is the angle shift, and D is
the y-axis shift. This method will repeat daily.

Daily (Bezier Curve) Method

A daily Bezier curve method define the setpoint over the day based on a
cubic Bezier curve. If unfamiliar with a Bezier curve, it is recommended
you use the graphical Bezier curve generator and use the 8 variables it
creates for 4 points (each a set of x and y). The x-axis start (x3) and
end (x0) will be automatically stretched or skewed to fit within a
24-hour period and this method will repeat daily.



PID TUNING


Function -> PIDs


PID Control Theory

The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in
industrial settings, for it"s ability to handle both simple and complex
regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional,
integral, and derivative.

The Proportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant Kp,
to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large
proportional output.

The Integral takes the error and multiplies it by Ki, then integrates it
(Ki · 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will
continually sum it and multiply it by the constant Ki. The integral is
used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using Kp alone
produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor
measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the
output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.

The Derivative multiplies the error by Kd, then differentiates it (Kd ·
s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will
change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path
becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of
dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the
measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and
the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the
desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or
too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the
three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated
Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much
each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a
gain (represented by _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_). By adjusting the gains, the
sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths
are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path
does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned
off.

The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was
designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This
feedback loop, with a _properly tuned_ PID controller, can achieve a set
point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little
oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.

Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a
temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and
cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value
would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would
rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a
lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the
error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the
temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be
acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative
output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the
temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would
normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can
be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.

Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_
can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance,
the _KI_ and _KD_ can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and
producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the
PI controller. It is recommended to start with only _KP_ activated, then
experiment with _KP_ and _KI_, before finally using all three. Because
systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the
degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need
to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.


Quick Setup Examples

These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation
in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure
your _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_ gains. There are a number of online resources
that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to
determine ideal PID values (such as here, here, here, here, and here)
and since there are no universal values that will work for every system,
it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the
variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively
implement them.

Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my
setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of _KP_ = 30, _KI_ =
1.0, and _KD_ = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of _KP_ =
1.0, _KI_ = 0.2, and _KD_ = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have
been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental
chamber.


Exact Temperature Regulation

This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a
certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that
cools).

Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each
sensor and activate the sensor.

Add two outputs, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.

Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change _Setpoint_ to
the desired temperature, _Regulate Direction_ to “Both”. Set _Raise
Output_ to the relay attached to the heating device and the _Lower
Relay_ to the relay attached to the cooling device.

Set _KP_ = 1, _KI_ = 0, and _KD_ = 0, then activate the PID.

If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should
activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the
temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than
the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate
until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is
not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase
the _KP_ value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with
different configurations involving only _Read Interval_ and _KP_ to
achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the _KI_ and _KD_ from 0 until
a working regulation is achieved with _KP_ alone.

View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the
temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by
well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and
tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the
proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with
little oscillation around the Setpoint.

Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing _KP_ slightly (~25%)
and increasing _KI_ by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower,
0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates.
Slowly increase _KI_ until regulation becomes both quick and with little
oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with
experimenting with the system and the _KD_ value can be experimented
with once both _KP_ and _KI_ have been tuned.


High Temperature Regulation

Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed.
For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the
system and only up-regulation can be used.

Use the same configuration as the Exact Temperature Regulation example,
except change _Regulate Direction_ to “Raise” and do not touch the “Down
Relay” section.

Input Settings

[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Inputs

Input modules may be imported and used within Mycodo. These modules must
follow a specific format. See Create an Input Module for more details.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Import Input Module     Select your input module file, then click this
                          button to begin the import.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Measurement Settings

[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Measurements

New measurements, units, and conversions can be created that can extend
functionality of Mycodo beyond the built-in types and equations. Be sure
to create units before measurements, as units need to be selected when
creating a measurement. A measurement can be created that already
exists, allowing additional units to be added to a pre-existing
measurement. For example, the measurement ‘altitude’ already exists,
however if you wanted to add the unit ‘fathom’, first create the unit
‘fathom’, then create the measurement ‘altitude’ with the ‘fathom’ unit
selected. It is okay to create a custom measurement for a measurement
that already exist (this is how new units for a currently-installed
measurement is added).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------

                          the measurement.

  Unit Name               Name for the unit (e.g. “Kilogram”, “Meter”).

  Unit Abbreviation       Abbreviation for the unit (e.g. “kg”, “m”).

  Convert From Unit       The unit that will be converted from.

  Convert To Unit         The unit that will be converted to.

  Equation                The equation used to convert one unit to
                          another. The lowercase letter “x” must be
                          included in the equation (e.g. “x/1000+20”,
                          “250*(x/3)”). This “x” will be replaced with the
                          actual measurement being converted.

Diagnostic Settings

[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Diagnostics

Sometimes issues arise in the system as a result of incompatible
configurations, either the result of a misconfigured part of the system
(Input, Output, etc.) or an update that didn’t properly handle a
database upgrade, or other unforeseen issue. Sometimes it is necessary
to perform diagnostic actions that can determine the cause of the issue
or fix the issue itself. The options below are meant to alleviate
issues, such as a misconfigured dashboard element causing an error on
the Dash page, which may cause an inability to access the Dash page to
correct the issue. Deleting all Dashboard Elements may be the most
economical method to enable access to the Dash page again, at the cost
of having to readd all the Dashboard Elements that were once there.

MISCELLANEOUS


Create an Input Module

_THIS SECTION IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS_

If you have a sensor that is not currently supported by Mycodo, you can
build your own input module and import it into Mycodo. All information
about an input is contained within the input module, set in the
dictionary ‘INPUT_INFORMATION’. Each module will requires at a minimum
for these variables to be set: ‘input_name_unique’,
‘input_manufacturer’, ‘input_name’, ‘measurements_name’, and
‘measurements_dict’.

Open any of the built-in modules located in the inputs directory
(https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/tree/master/mycodo/inputs/) for
examples of the proper formatting.

There’s also minimal input module template that generates random data as
an example:

https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/tree/master/mycodo/inputs/examples/minimal_humidity_temperature.py

The following link provides the full list of available INPUT_INFORMATION
options along with descriptions:

Live Measurements

Live

The Live page is the first page a user sees after logging in to Mycodo.
It will display the current measurements being acquired from Input and
Math controllers. If there is nothing displayed on the Live page, ensure
an Input or Math controller is both configured correctly and activated.
Data will be automatically updated on the page from the measurement
database.


Asynchronous Graphs

Async

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning
relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be
very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Live Graph. Select a
time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists.
The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every
view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700
data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be
created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables
much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4
months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded.
However, when viewing a 4 month span, it’s not possible to see every
data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is
inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what
you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only
~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which
time only another ~50kb is downloaded.

Note: Live Graphs require measurements to be acquired, therefore at
least one sensor needs to be added and activated in order to display
live data.


Notes

More -> Notes

Notes may be created that can then be displayed on graphs or referenced
at a later time. All notes are timestamped with the date/time of
creation or may be created with a custom date/time. Each note must have
at least one tag selected. Tags are what are selected to be displayed on
a graph and all notes with that tag will appear in the time frame
selected on the graph.

Tag Options

  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Name                    A name for the tag. Must not contain spaces.
  Rename                  Rename the tag.

Note Options

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Name                    A name for the note.

  Use Custom Date/Time    Check to enter a custom date/time for the note.

  Custom Date/Time        Store the note with this custom date/time.

  Attached Files          Attach one or more files to the note.

  Tags                    Associate the note with at least one tag.

  Note                    The text body of the note. The text will appear
                          monospaced, so code will format properly.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Export-Import

More -> Export Import

Measurements that fall within the selected date/time frame may be
exported as CSV with their corresponding timestamps.

Additionally, the entire measurement database (influxdb) may be exported
as a ZIP archive backup. This ZIP may be imported back in any Mycodo
system to restore these measurements. Note that an import will override
the current data (i.e. destroying it).

Mycodo settings may be exported as a ZIP file containing the Mycodo
settings database (sqlite). This ZIP file may be used to restore the
settings database to another Mycodo install, as long as the Mycodo
version and database versions are the same. Future support for
installing older (or newer) databases and performing an automatic
upgrade/downgrade is in the works.


Dependencies

[Gear Icon] -> Dependencies

The dependency page allows viewing of dependency information and the
ability to initiate their installation.

During the installation of Mycodo, there is an option to select which
dependencies to install. If “Minimal Install” or “Custom Install” was
selected (rather than “Full Install”), there may be unmet dependencies
on your system. Don’t worry, this isn’t necessarily a problem. These
optional dependencies only need to be installed when there’s a
particular feature you want to use. When a user attempts to use a
feature that has an unmet dependency, the user will be forwarded to the
Dependency page in order to install it.


Camera

Cam

Once a cameras has been set up (in the Camera Settings), it may be used
to capture still images, create time-lapses, and stream video. Cameras
may also be used by Conditional Statements to trigger a camera image or
video capture (as well as the ability to email the image/video with a
notification).


Energy Usage

More -> Energy Usage

There are two methods for calculating energy usage. The first relies on
determining how long Outputs have been on. Based on this, if the number
of Amps the output draws has been set in the output Settings, then the
kWh and cost can be calculated. Discovering the number of amps the
device draws can be accomplished by calculating this from the output
typically given as watts on the device label, or with the use of a
current clamp while the device is operating. The limitation of this
method is PWM Outputs are not currently used to calculate these figures
due to the difficulty determining the current consumption of devices
driven by PWM signals.

The second method for calculating energy consumption is more accurate
and is the recommended method if you desire the most accurate estimation
of energy consumption and cost. This method relies on an Input or Math
measuring Amps. One way to do this is with the used of an
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that converts the voltage output from
a transformer into current (Amps). One wire from the AC line that powers
your device(s) passes thorough the transformer and the device converts
the current that passes through that wire into a voltage that
corresponds to the amperage. For instance, the below sensor converts 0 -
50 amps input to 0 - 5 volts output. An ADC receives this output as its
input. One would set this conversion range in Mycodo and the calculated
amperage will be stored. On the Energy Usage page, add this ADC Input
measurement and a report summary will be generated. Keep in mind that
for a particular period (for example, the past week) to be accurate,
there needs to be a constant measurement of amps at a periodic rate. The
faster the rate the more accurate the calculation will be. This is due
to the amperage measurements being averaged for this period prior to
calculating kWh and cost. If there is any time turing this period where
amp measurements aren’t being acquired when in fact there are devices
consuming current, the calculation is likely to not be accurate.

The following settings are for calculating energy usage from an amp
measurement. For calculating based on Output duration, see Energy Usage
Settings.

Backup-Restore

[Gear Icon] -> Backup Restore

A backup is made to /var/Mycodo-backups when the system is upgraded or
through the web interface on the [Gear Icon] -> Backup Restore page.

If you need to restore a backup, this can be done on the
[Gear Icon] -> Backup  Restore page. Find the backup you would like
restored and press the Restore button beside it. A restore can also be
initialized through the command line. Use the following commands to
initialize a restore, changing the appropriate directory names, ‘user’
to your user name, and TIME and COMMIT to the appropriate text found as
the directory names in /var/Mycodo-backups/

    sudo mv /home/user/Mycodo /home/user/Mycodo_old
    sudo cp -a /var/Mycodo-backups/Mycodo-TIME-COMMIT /home/user/Mycodo
    sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_post.sh


System Information

[Gear Icon] -> System Information

This page serves to provide information about the Mycodo frontend and
backend as well as the linux system it’s running on. Several commands
and their output are listed to give the user information about how their
system is running.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Mycodo Version          The current version of Mycodo, reported by the
                          configuration file.

  Python Version          The version of python currently running the web
                          user interface.

  Database Version        The current version of the settings database. If
                          the current version is different from what it
                          should be, an error will appear indicating the
                          issue and a link to find out more information
                          about the issue.

  Daemon Status           This will be a green “Running” or a red
                          “Stopped”. Additionally, the Mycodo version and
                          hostname text at the top-left of the screen May
                          be Green, Yellow, or Red to indicate the status.
                          Green = daemon running, yellow = unable to
                          connect, and red = daemon not running.

  …                       Several other status indicators and commands are
                          listed to provide information about the health
                          of the system. Use these in addition to others
                          to investigate software or hardware issues.

USB Device Persistence Across Reboots

From (#547) Theoi-Meteoroi on Github:

Using USB devices, such as USB-to-serial interfaces to connect a sensor,
while convenient, poses an issue if there are multiple devices when the
system reboots. After a reboot, there is no guarantee the device will
persist with the same name. For instance, if Sensor A is /dev/ttyUSB0
and Sensor B is /dev/ttyUSB1, after a reboot Sensor A may be
/dev/ttyUSB1 and Sensor B may be /dev/ttyUSB0. This will cause Mycodo to
query the wrong device for a measurement, potentially causing a
mis-measurement, or worse, an incorrect measurement because the response
is not from the correct sensor (I’ve seen my temperature sensor read
700+ degrees celsius because of this!). Follow the instructions below to
alleviate this issue.

I use udev to create a persistent device name (‘/dev/dust-sensor’) that
will be linked to the /dev/ttyUSBn that is chosen at device arrival in
the kernel. The only requirement is some attribute returned from the USB
device that is unique. The common circumstance is that none of the
attributes are unique and you get stuck with just VID and PID, which is
ok as long as you don’t have any other adapters that report the same VID
and PID. If you have multiple adapters with the same VID and PID, then
hopefully they have some unique attribute. This command will walk the
attributes. Run on each USB device and then compare differences to
possibly find some attribute to use.

udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk

I ended up using the serial number on the ZH03B to program the USB
adapter serial field. This way guarantees unique serial numbers rather
than me trying to remember what was the last serial number I used to
increment by 1.

When you plug a USB device in it can be enumerated to different device
names by the operating system. To fix this problem for this sensor on
linux, I changed attributes that make the connection unique.

First - find the VID and PID for the USB device:

    pi@raspberry:~ $ lsusb
    Bus 001 Device 008: ID 10c4:ea60 Cygnal Integrated Products, Inc. CP210x UART Bridge / myAVR mySmartUSB light
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0424:ec00 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMSC9512/9514 Fast Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:9514 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMC9514 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

In this case the Vendor ID is 10c4 The Product ID is ea60

Since I changed the serial number field - this will be unique.

    pi@raspberry:~ $ udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk | grep serial
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb-serial"
    ATTRS{serial}=="ZH03B180904"
    ATTRS{serial}=="3f980000.usb"

Now I have an attribute to tell udev what to do. I create a file in
/etc/udev/rules.d with a name like “99-dustsensor.rules”. In that file I
tell udev what device name to create when it sees this device plugged
in:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", ATTRS{serial}=="ZH03B180904" SYMLINK+="dust-sensor"

To test the new rule:

    pi@raspberry:/dev $ sudo udevadm trigger
    pi@raspberry:/dev $ ls -al dust-sensor
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Oct 6 21:04 dust-sensor -> ttyUSB0

Now, every time the dust sensor is plugged in, it shows up at
/dev/dust-sensor


Infrared Remote

Infrared (IR) light is a common way to send and receive signals across
distances. This is typically done with IR remotes with several buttons
configured to send different signals. These signals can be detected by
the Raspberry Pi with the use of an IR receiver diode and used to
perform actions within the linux environment and Mycodo. This is done
with lirc, and needs to be properly configured before IR signals can be
detected and interpreted.

The IR receiver typically has three connections, power (3.3 volts),
ground, and data (GPIO pin), and should be connected to the appropriate
pins of your Raspberry Pi. Make sure your IR receiver can operate at 3.3
volts, which is the appropriate voltage GPIOs operate at. For testing, I
used the Sparkfun Infrared Control Kit, which has an Information Guide,
however there are cheaper alternatives.

Adding an Infrared Output device or an Infrared Send function action
will automatically install the dependencies, otherwise it can be done
manually:

sudo apt install liblircclient-dev lirc

~/Mycodo/env/bin/pip install python-lirc py-irsend

Edit /boot/config.txt and add to the end of the file, replacing 17 from
gpio_out_pin=17 with the GPIO (BCM numbering) connected to your IR LED
and 18 from gpio_in_pin=18 connected to the IR receiver. You can omit
either of these options if you aren’t using either the IR receiver or
transmitting LED:

dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_out_pin=17,gpio_in_pin=18,gpio_in_pull=up

Edit /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf and ensure the following settings are
set:

    driver = default
    device = /dev/lirc0

Restart your system:

sudo shutdown now -r

Check this remote database for your remote, and if it’s found, place it
in /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/, otherwise you will need to generate a config
file for your remote.

To generate a config file for your remote, lirc must first be stopped:

sudo service lircd stop

Then, issue the following command:

sudo irrecord -n -d /dev/lirc0

You will be prompted with a very specific set of instructions in order
to map your remote. If you successfully finish the config generation,
you will have a *.lirc.conf file that you should place in
/etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/

If irrecord is unable to parse the remote code (due to complexity or
other issue), you can still use the raw data to create a config file. To
obtain the raw code data, run the following command, and press a button
on the remote once.

mode2 -m

You should see output similar to the following, with data represented in
6 columns.

    pi@rapsberry:~ $ mode2 -m
    Using driver default on device /dev/lirc0
    Trying device: /dev/lirc0
    Using device: /dev/lirc0
     16777215

         3431     1747      444     1313      441     1312
          444      471      441      474      440      474
          440     1315      439      476      438      480
          444     1312      442     1313      441      475
          438     1317      439      476      437      477

Use the 6-column data to generate your config file, with the following
as an example example_remote.lircd.conf, that should be placed in
/etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/.

    begin remote
      name  example_remote
      flags RAW_CODES
      eps           30
      aeps          100

      ptrail       0
      repeat       0  0
      gap          107902

          begin raw_codes
              name KEY_POWER
                 3431     1747      444     1313      441     1312
                  444      471      441      474      440      474
                  440     1315      439      476      438      480
                  444     1312      442     1313      441      475
                  438     1317      439      476      437      477
          end raw_codes
    end remote

Start lirc back up to load all the remote config files:

sudo service lirc start

Now, start irw and press a button on your remote. If everything works,
you should see information appear when you press each button, such as
below:

    pi@raspberry:~ $ irw
    0000000000ff629d 00 KEY_POWER simple_remote
    0000000000ff22dd 01 KEY_A simple_remote
    0000000000ff02fd 01 KEY_B simple_remote
    0000000000ffc23d 00 KEY_C simple_remote
    0000000000ff9867 00 KEY_UP simple_remote
    0000000000ff38c7 00 KEY_DOWN simple_remote
    0000000000ff30cf 01 KEY_LEFT simple_remote
    0000000000ff7a85 00 KEY_RIGHT simple_remote
    0000000000ff18e7 01 KEY_SELECT simple_remote

Now that we have the remote detected and mapped, we can set commands to
be executed or what word is returned to Mycodo. Create a file ~/.lirc:

nano ~/.lircrc

and configure the responses to button presses

    begin
      button = KEY_POWER
      prog = mycodo
      config = power
      repeat = 0
    end
    begin
      button = KEY_A
      prog = mycodo
      config = a
      repeat = 0
    end

To test this with Python, create the test program infrared_receive.py:

    import lirc
    import time

    sockid = lirc.init("mycodo", blocking=False)
    while True:
        code = lirc.nextcode()
        if code:
            print(code[0])
        time.sleep(0.05)

Execute this using the Mycodo virtualenv:

~/Mycodo/env/bin/python infrared_receive.py

And press the buttons defined in ~/.lirc and see if the output appears
on the console:

    pi@raspberry:~ $ ~/Mycodo/env/bin/python ./test_IR.py
    power
    a

From here, you can create any Python code to react to button presses on
your remote. You can also set up the Mycodo Function Trigger: Infrared
Remote Input and trigger events in response to Mycodo detecting specific
button presses. See Infrared Remote Input Options for configuring this
trigger.

In order to send an IR signal to your IR LED, connect your LED to the
GPIO defined with gpio_out_pin=17 in /boot/config.txt. You can test if
your LED is working by creating a file, LED_blink.py, replacing 17 with
the pin connected to your LED:

    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
    import time

    pin = 17
    GPIO.setwarnings(False)
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
    GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW)

    while True:
        GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.HIGH)
        time.sleep(1)
        GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW)
        time.sleep(1)

Since IR LEDs produce a wavelength of light that humans can’t see,
you’ll need to aim a video camera that lacks an infrared filter and see
if the LED is blinking.

If your LED is working, then issue the following command, replacing
simple_remote with the name of your remote defined in your config file:

irsend SEND_ONCE simple_remote KEY_POWER

You can verify this is working by running infrared_receive.py, then
executing the irsend command while it’s still running, and you should
see it print the button command that was sent.

IR codes can be sent from Mycodo using the Infrared Remote Send Function
Action. The Remote option should to match the remote name in the config
file in /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/ and the Code option should match a code
that’s in /home/pi/.lircrc. If Times to Send is set larger than 1, the
code will be sent multiple times at intervals of 0.5 seconds.



TROUBLESHOOTING


Daemon Not Running

-   Check the Logs: From the [Gear Icon] -> Mycodo Logs page, check the
    Daemon Log for any errors. If the issue began after an upgrade, also
    check the Upgrade Log for indications of an issue.
-   Determine if the Daemon is Running: Execute
    ps aux | grep '/var/mycodo-root/env/bin/python /var/mycodo-root/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py'
    in a terminal and look for an entry to be returned. If nothing is
    returned, the daemon is not running.
-   Daemon Lock File: If the daemon is not running, make sure the daemon
    lock file is deleted at /var/lock/mycodo.pid. The daemon cannot
    start if the lock file is present.
-   If a solution could not be found after investigating the above
    suggestions, submit a New Mycodo Issue on github.


Incorrect Database Version

-   Check the [Gear Icon] -> System Information page or select the
    mycodo logo in the top-left.
-   An incorrect database version error means the version stored in the
    Mycodo settings database (~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db) is not
    correct for the latest version of Mycodo, determined in the Mycodo
    config file (~/Mycodo/mycodo/config.py).
-   This can be caused by an error in the upgrade process from an older
    database version to a newer version, or from a database that did not
    upgrade during the Mycodo upgrade process.
-   Check the Upgrade Log for any issues that may have occurred. The log
    is located at /var/log/mycodo/mycodoupgrade.log but may also be
    accessed from the web UI (if you’re able to): select [Gear Icon] ->
    Mycodo Logs -> Upgrade Log.
-   Sometimes issues may not immediately present themselves. It is not
    uncommon to be experiencing a database issue that was actually
    introduced several Mycodo versions ago, before the latest upgrade.
-   Because of the nature of how many versions the database can be in,
    correcting a database issue may be very difficult. It may be much
    easier to delete your database and let Mycodo generate a new one.
-   Use the following commands to rename your database and restart the
    web UI. If both commands are successful, refresh your web UI page in
    your browser in order to generate a new database and create a new
    Admin user.

&nbsp;
    mv ~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db ~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db.backup
    sudo service mycodoflask restart

DEVICES


All Input and Output devices are listed below.

The I2C interface should be enabled with raspi-config.

The 1-wire interface should be configured with these instructions.

This documentation provides specific installation procedures for
configuring UART with the Raspberry Pi version 1 or 2.

The K30 may be tested by executing
~/Mycodo/mycodo/tests/manual_tests/test_uart_K30.py

For Atlas Scientific sensors, this guide may be used, as well as the
above K-30 guide, to set up UART on the Raspberry Pi 1 and 2. However,
for Pi 3s, use the procedure below.

Because the UART is handled differently by the Raspberry Pi 3, from of
the addition of bluetooth, there are a different set of instructions. If
installing Mycodo on a Raspberry Pi 3, you only need to perform these
steps to configure UART:

Run raspi-config

sudo raspi-config

Edge Detection

The detection of a changing signal, for instance a simple switch
completing a circuit, requires the use of edge detection. By detecting a
rising edge (LOW to HIGH), a falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both,
actions or events can be triggered. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal
should be equipped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the
GPIO up [to 5-volts] or down [to ground]. The option to enable the
internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety
reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low.

Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple
switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect
sensors, float switches, and more.


I2C Multiplexers

All devices that connected to the Raspberry Pi by the I2C bus need to
have a unique address in order to communicate. Some inputs may have the
same address (such as the AM2315), which prevents more than one from
being connected at the same time. Others may provide the ability to
change the address, however the address range may be limited, which
limits by how many you can use at the same time. I2C multiplexers are
extremely clever and useful in these scenarios because they allow
multiple sensors with the same I2C address to be connected.

Multiplexers can be set up by loading a kernel driver to handle the
communication, producing a new I2C bus device for each multiplexer
channel. To enable the driver for the TCA9548A/PCA9548A, visit
GPIO-pca9548 to get the code and latest install instructions. If
successfully set up, there will be 8 new I2C buses on the
[Gear Icon] -> System Information page.

The driver for the TCA9545A can be found at
https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a and other drivers are
available elsewhere. See the manufacturer or user forums for details.
Some multiplexers I’ve tested are below.

  TCA9548A/PCA9548A: I2C Multiplexer link (I2C): Has 8 selectable
  addresses, so 8 multiplexers can be connected to one Raspberry Pi.
  Each multiplexer has 8 channels, allowing up to 8 devices/sensors with
  the same address to be connected to each multiplexer. 8 multiplexers x
  8 channels = 64 devices/sensors with the same I2C address.

  TCA9545A: I2C Bus Multiplexer link (I2C): This board also creates 4
  new I2C buses, but each with their own selectable voltage, either 3.3
  or 5.0 volts.


Analog-to-Digital Converters

An analog to digital converter (ADC) allows the use of any analog sensor
that outputs a variable voltage. A voltage divider may be necessary to
attain your desired range.

Notes

From @Theoi-Meteoroi on GitHub:

I figured out why this [AM2315] sensor is unreliable with Rpi3 hardware
I2C. It is among a number of I2C devices that really hates the BCM2835
clock stretching blunder (hardware bug: raspberrypi/linux#254). The
wakeup attempts fail, consistently. I checked the bitstream with a
sniffer, and see that the sensor may respond once out of 20 or so tries
(or not at all) but only with a single byte returned. The solution is to
use a software implementation of the I2C bus. You need to add pull-up
resistors (4.7k is dandy) to 3.3v and install the i2c_gpio device
overlay. Seems to work fine now, will run for a few days, but the CRC
failures are gone and I get good readings, every time. And no twiddling
the power for the sensor is required.

To enable software I2C, add the following line to your /boot/config.txt

dtoverlay=i2c-gpio,i2c_gpio_sda=23,i2c_gpio_scl=24,i2c_gpio_delay_us=4

After rebooting, a new I2C bus at /dev/i2c-3 should exist with SDA on
pin 23 (BCM) and SCL on pin 24 (BCM). Make sure you add the appropriate
pull-up resistors before connecting any devices.
