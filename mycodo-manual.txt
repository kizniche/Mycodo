ABOUT MYCODO


Mycodo is an automated monitoring and regulation system that was built
to run on the Raspberry Pi (versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3).

Orignially designed to cultivate edible mushrooms, Mycodo has grown to
include the ability to do much more, including cultivating plants,
culturing microorganisms, maintaining honey bee apiary homeostasis,
incubating animals and eggs, maintaining aquatic systems, aging cheeses,
fermenting foods and tobacco, cooking food (vous-vide), and more.

The system comprises a backend (daemon) and a frontend (user interface).
The backend conducts measurements from sensors and devices, then
coordinate a diverse set of responses to those measurements, including
the ability to modulate outputs (relays, PWM, wireless outlets),
regulate environmental conditions with electrical devices under PID
control (steady regulation or changing over time), schedule timers,
capture photos and stream video, trigger actions when measurements meet
certain conditions (modulate relays, execute commands, notify by email,
etc.), and more. The frontend is a web interface that enables easy
navigation and configuration from any browser-enabled device.



BRIEF OVERVIEW


There are a number of different uses for Mycodo. Some users simply store
sensor measurements to monitor conditons remotely from their phone,
others regulate the environmental conditions of a physical space, while
others capture motion-activated or timelapse photography, and more.

Input controllers acquire measurements and store them in a time series
database. Measurements typically come from sensors, but may also be
configured to use the return value of a linux command, making
integrating new inputs very easy.

Output controllers produce changes to the general input/output (GPIO)
pins or may be configured to execute linux commands in order to allow an
unlimited number of potential uses. There are a few different types of
outputs: simple switching of pins (HIGH/LOW), generating pulse-width
modulated (PWM) signals, switching 433 MHz wireless relays, and linux
command execution. The most common setup is using a relay to switch
electrical devices on and off.

When Inputs and Outputs are combined, PID controllers may be used to
create a feedback loop that uses the Output device to modulate an
environmental condition the Input detects. Certain Inputs may be coupled
with certain Outputs to create a variety of different control and
regulation applications. Beyond simple regulation, Methods may be used
to create changing setpoints over time, enabling such things as thermal
cyclers, reflow ovens, environmental simulation for terrariums, food and
beverage fermentation or curing, and cooking food (sous-vide), to name a
few.

Conditionals can be set to trigger events based on specific dates and
times or according to durations of time. Conditionals are fairly basic,
but can be configured in very complex ways. Don’t underestimate a good
conditional.



FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


_What should I do if I have an issue?_

First, read though this manual to make sure you understand how the
system works and you’re using the system properly. Also check out the
Mycodo Wiki. You may even want to look through recent GitHub Issues. If
you haven’t resolved your issue by this point, make a New GitHub Issue
describing the issue and attaching a sufficient amount of evidence
(screenshots, log files, etc.) to aid in diagnosing the issue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_How do I add an Input (like a sensor) to the system if it’s not
currently supported?_

Currently, adding an Input device that’s not currently supported can be
achieved by two different methods:

The first involves editing several internal Mycodo files. There has been
effort to make the addition process as simple as possible. See the
Adding Support for a New Input Wiki page for how to do this. All changes
will be lost during an upgrade, therefore it is suggested to make a
GitHub pull request with your changes to permanently integrate them into
Mycodo.

The second way to add an Input is to create a script that obtains and
returns a numerical value when executed in the linux system of the
Raspberry Pi. This script may be configured to be executed by a “Linux
Command” Input type. This will periodically execute the command and
store the returned value to the database for use with the rest of the
Mycodo system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_How do I set up simple regulation?_

Here is how I generally set up Mycodo to monitor and regulate:

1.  Determine what environmental condition you want to measure
    or regulate. Consider the devices that must be coupled to achieve
    this. For instance, temperature regulation require a temperature
    sensor as the input and an electric heater (or cooler) as
    the output.
2.  Determine what relays you will need to power your electric devices.
    The Raspberry Pi is capable of directly switching relays (using a
    3.3-volt signal). Remember to select a relay that can handle the
    load and doesn’t exceed the maximum current draw from the Raspberry
    Pi GPIO pins.
3.  See the Device Specific Information for information about what
    sensors are supported. Acquire sensor(s) and relay(s) and connect
    them to the Raspberry Pi according to the
    manufacturer’s instructions.
4.  On the Data page, create a new input using the dropdown to select
    the correct sensor or input device. Configure the input with the
    correct communication pins and other options. Activate the input to
    begin recording measurements to the database.
5.  Go to the Info -> Live Measurements page to ensure there is recent
    data being acquired from the input.
6.  On the Ouput page, add a relay and configure the GPIO pin that
    switches it, whether the relay switches On when the signal is HIGH
    or LOW, and what state (On or Off) to set the relay when Mycodo
    starts. A pulse-width modulated (PWM) output may also be used,
    among others.
7.  Test the relay by switching it On and Off or generating a PWM signal
    from the Output page and make sure the device connected to the relay
    turns On when you select “On”, and Off when you select “Off”.
8.  On the Function page, create a PID controller with the appropriate
    input, output, and other parameters. Activate the PID controller.
9.  On the Info -> Dashboard page, create a graph that includes the
    input measurement, the output that is being used by the PID, and the
    PID output and setpoint. This provides a good visualization for
    tuning the PID. See Quick Setup Examples for a greater detail of
    this process and tuning tips.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Can I communicate with Mycodo from the command line?_

Yes, ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_client.py has this functionality, but
there’s a lot to be desired. Below may not be the most current list of
commands, so it’s recommended to execute the installed symlink
mycodo-client -h to see a full list with descriptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Can I variably-control the speed of motors or other devices with the
PWM output signal from the PID?_

Yes, as long as you have the proper hardware to do that. The PWM signal
being produced by the PID should be handled appropriately, whether by a
fast-switching solid state relay, an AC modulation circuit, DC
modulation circuit, or something else.

UPGRADING


If you already have Mycodo installed (version >= 4.0.0), you can perform
an upgrade to the latest Mycodo Release by either using the Upgrade
option in the web interface (recommended) or by issuing the following
command in a terminal. A log of the upgrade process is created at
/var/log/mycodo/mycodoupgrade.log

    sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_commands.sh upgrade



FEATURES


The following sections describe the essential modules of Mycodo that can
be used to perform functions or communicate with other parts of Mycodo.
Each section performs specific tasks or groups of related tasks.


Data

Data includes controllers that produce and store data in the measurement
database. Input controllers generally acquire measurements from sensors,
but they may also come from executed commands. Math controllers, on the
other hand, perform math on already-stored values to create new values
that are stored.

Input

Inputs (such as sensors or analog signals) measure environmental
conditions, which will be stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB).
This database will provide measurements for Graphs, LCDs, PID
Controllers, Conditional Statements, and other parts of Mycodo to
operate from.

In addition to several supported sensors and devices, a Linux command
may be specified that will be executed and the return value stored in
the measurement database to be used throughout the Mycodo system.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Activate                After the sensor has been properly configured,
                          activation begins acquiring measurements from
                          the sensor. Any activated conditional statements
                          will now being operating.

  Deactivate              Deactivation stops measurements from being
                          acquired from the sensor. All associated
                          conditional statements will cease to operate.

  Save                    Save the current configuration entered into the
                          input boxes for a particular sensor.

  Delete                  Delete a particular sensor.

  Up/Down                 Move a particular sensor up or down in the order
                          displayed.

  Power Output            Select a output that powers the sensor. This
                          enables powering cycling (turn off then on) when
                          the sensor returns 3 consecutive errors to
                          attempt to fix the issue. Transistors may also
                          be used instead of a relay (note: NPN
                          transistors are preferred over PNP for powering
                          sensors).

  Location                Depending on what sensor is being used, you will
                          need to either select a serial number (DS18B20
                          temperature sensor), a GPIO pin (in the case of
                          sensors read by a GPIO), or an I2C address. or
                          other.

  I2C Bus                 The bus to be used to communicate with the I2C
                          address.

  Period (seconds)        After the sensor is successfully read and a
                          database entry is made, this is the duration of
                          time waited until the sensor is measured again.

  Measurement Unit        Select the unit to save the measurement as (only
                          available for select measurements).

  Pre Output              If you require a output to be activated before a
                          measurement is made (for instance, if you have a
                          pump that extracts air to a chamber where the
                          sensor resides), this is the output number that
                          will be activated. The output will be activated
                          for a duration defined by the Pre Duration, then
                          once the output turns off, a measurement by the
                          sensor is made.

  Pre Output Duration     This is the duration of time that the Pre Output
  (seconds)               runs for before the sensor measurement is
                          obtained.

  Pre Output During       If enabled, the Pre Output stays on during the
  Measurement             acquisition of a measurement. If disabled, the
                          Pre Output is turned off directly before
                          acquiring a measurement.

  Command                 A linux command (executed as the user ‘mycodo’)
                          that the return value becomes the measurement

  Command Measurement     The measured condition (e.g. temperature,
                          humidity, etc.) from the linux command

  Command Units           The units of the measurement condition from the
                          linux command

  Edge                    Edge sensors only: Select whether the Rising or
                          Falling (or both) edges of a changing voltage
                          are detected. A number of devices to do this
                          when in-line with a circuit supplying a 3.3-volt
                          input signal to a GPIO, such as simple
                          mechanical switch, a button, a magnet
                          (reed/hall) sensor, a PIR motion detector, and
                          more.

  Bounce Time (ms)        Edge sensors only: This is the number of
                          milliseconds to bounce the input signal. This is
                          commonly called debouncing a
                          signal <http://kylegabriel.com/projects/2016/02
                          /morse-code-translator.html#debouncing>__. and
                          may be necessary if using a mechanical circuit.

  Reset Period (seconds)  Edge sensors only: This is the period of time
                          after an edge detection that another edge will
                          not be recorded. This enables devices such as
                          PIR motion sensors that may stay activated for
                          longer periods of time.

  Measurement             Analog-to-digital converter only: The type of
                          measurement being acquired by the ADC. For
                          instance, if the resistance of a photocell is
                          being measured through a voltage divider, this
                          measurement would be “light”.

  Units                   Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the
                          unit of the measurement. With the above example
                          of “light” as the measurement, the unit may be
                          “lux” or “intensity”.

  Clock Pin               The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the
                          Clock pin of the ADC

  CS Pin                  The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the
                          CS pin of the ADC

  MISO Pin                The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the
                          MISO pin of the ADC

  MOSI Pin                The GPIO (using BCM numbering) connected to the
                          MOSI pin of the ADC

  RTD Probe Type          Select to measure from a PT100 or PT1000 probe.

  Resistor Reference      If your reference resistor is not the default
  (Ohm)                   (400 Ohm for PT100, 4000 Ohm for PT1000), you
                          can manually set this value. Several
                          manufacturers now use 430 Ohm resistors on their
                          circuit boards, therefore it’s recommended to
                          verify the accuracy of your measurements and
                          adjust this value if necessary.

  Channel                 Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the
                          channel to obtain the voltage measurement from
                          the ADC.

  Gain                    Analog-to-digital converter only: set the gain
                          when acquiring the measurement.

  Volts Min               Analog-to-digital converter only: What is the

                          volts for your particular circuit, set this to

                          unit output. For instance, if your voltage range

                          60, and a voltage of 0.5 is measured, in

  Measurements)                 selected measurements.

  Average (Single Measurement)  Stores the statistical mean of one
                                selected measurement over a duration of

                                option.

  Difference                    Stores the mathematical difference
                                (value_1 -value_2).

  Verification                  Ensures the greatest difference between
                                any selected Inputs is less than Max
                                Difference, and if so, stores the average
                                of the selected measurements.

  Period (seconds)        The duration of time between calculating and
                          storing a new value

  Max Age (seconds)       The maximum allowed age of the Input
                          measurements. If an Input measurement is older
                          than this period, the calculation is cancelled
                          and the new value is not stored in the database.
                          Consequently, if another controller has a Max
                          Age set and cannot retrieve a current Math
                          value, it will cease functioning. A PID
                          controller, for instance, may stop regulating if
                          there is no new Math value created, preventing
                          the PID controller from continuing to run when
                          it should not.

  Measurement             This is the condition being measured. For
                          instance, if all of the selected measurements
                          are temperature, this should also be
                          temperature. A list of the pre-defined
                          measurements that may be used is below.

  Units                   This is the units to display along with the
                          measurement, on Graphs. If a pre-defined
                          measurement is used, this field will default to
                          the units associated with that measurement.

  Reverse Equation        For Difference calculations, this will reverse
                          the equation order, from value_1 - value_2 to
                          value_2 - value_1.

  Absolute Value          For Difference calculations, this will yield an
                          absolute value (positive number).

  Max Difference          If the difference between any selected Input is
                          greater than this value, no new value will be
                          stored in the database.

  Dry-Bulb Temperature    The measurement that will serve as the dry-bulb
                          temperature (this is the warmer of the two
                          temperature measurements)

  Wet-Bulb Temperature    The measurement that will serve as the wet-bulb
                          temperature (this is the colder of the two
                          temperature measurements)

  Pressure                This is an optional pressure measurement that
                          can be used to calculate the percent relative
                          humidity. If disabled, a default 101325 Pa will
                          be used in the calculation.

  Equation                An equation that will be solved with Python’s
                          eval() function. Let “x” represent the input
                          value. Valid equation symbols include: + - * / ^
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-defined Measurements

If a pre-defined measurement is used, the newly-generated value will use
that default y-axes on a Graph. For instance, if two temperature
measurements are selected for averaging, and Measurement is set to
‘temperature’ (lowercase ‘t’), the new average value will use the same
y-axis as the other temperatures.

Output

Outputs are various signals that can be generated that operate devices.
An output can be a PWM signal, a simple HIGH/LOW signal to operate a
relay, or a 433MHz signal to switch a radio frequency-operated relay, or
an execution of a command on the linux system Mycodo runs on.

PWM

Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique used to encode a
message into a pulsing signal, at a specific frequency in Hertz (Hz).
The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled
by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate.
The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the
total power supplied to the load.

The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect
the load (the device that uses the power), which is to say that the
resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible.
The rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary
greatly depending on load and application, for example

  Switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove;
  120 Hz in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz
  for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio
  amplifiers and computer power supplies.

The term duty cycle describes the proportion of ‘on’ time to the regular
interval or ‘period’ of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power,
because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed
in percent, 100% being fully on.

PWM pins can be set up on the Output page, then it may be used by a PWM
PID Controller.

                          can produce up to a 40 kHz PWM signal. See the
                          table, below, for the hardware pins on various
                          Pi boards.

                          time off, expressed in percent (0 - 100).

  Current Draw (amps)     This is the current draw, in amps, when the duty
                          cycle is 100%. Note: this value should be
                          calculated based on the voltage set in the
                          Output Usage Settings.

Non-hardware PWM Pins

When using non-hardware PWM pins, there are only certain frequencies
that can be used. These frequencies in Hertz are 40000, 20000, 10000,
8000, 5000, 4000, 2500, 2000, 1600, 1250, 1000, 800, 500, 400, 250, 200,
100, and 50 Hz. If you attempt to set a frequency that is not listed
here, the nearest frequency from this list will be used.

Hardware PWM Pins

The exact frequency may be set when using hardware PWM pins. The same
PWM channel is available on multiple GPIO. The latest frequency and duty
cycle setting will be used by all GPIO pins which share a PWM channel.

Relays

Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small
voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger
voltage, without exposing the low-voltage system to the dangers of the
higher voltage.

Add and configure outputs in the Output tab. Outputs must be properly
set up before PID regulation can be achieved.

Wired

To set up a wired relay, set the “GPIO Pin” to the BCM GPIO number of
each pin that activates each relay. _On Trigger_ should be set to the
signal that activates the relay (the device attached to the relay turns
on). If your relay activates when the potential across the coil is
0-volts, set _On Trigger_ to “Low”, otherwise if your relay activates
when the potential across the coil is 3.3-volts (or whatever switching
voltage you are using, if not being driven by the GPIO pin), set it to
“High”.

Wireless

Certain 433 MHz wireless relays may be used, however you will need to
set the pin of the transmitter (using WiringPi numbering), pulse length,
bit length, protocol, on command, and off command. To determine your on
and off commands, connect a 433 MHz receiver to your Pi, then run the
receiver script, below, and press one of the buttons (either on or off)
on your remote to detect the numeric code associated with that button.

    sudo ~/Mycodo/env/bin/python ~/Mycodo/mycodo/devices/wireless_433mhz_pi_switch.py

433 MHz wireless relays have been successfully tested with SMAKN 433MHz
RF Transmitters/Receivers and Etekcity Wireless Remote Control
Electrical Outlets (see Issue 88 for more information). If you have a
433 MHz transmitter/receiver and a wireless relay that does not work
with the current code (even after trying several different protocol
settings), submit a new issue with details of your hardware.

Command

Another option for output control is to execute a terminal command when
the output is turned on, off, or a duty cycle. Commands will be executed
as the user ‘root’.

Wireless and Command Output Note: Since the wireless protocol only
allows 1-way communication to 433 MHz devices, wireless relays are
assumed to be off until they are turned on, and therefore will appear
red (off) when added. If a wireless relay is turned off or on outside
Mycodo (by a remote, for instance), Mycodo will _NOT_ be able to
determine the state of the relay and will indicate whichever state the
relay was last. This is, if Mycodo turns the wireless relay on, and a
remote is used to turn the relay off, Mycodo will still assume the relay
is on.

  On Trigger              This is the state of the GPIO to signal the
                          output to turn the device on. HIGH will send a
                          3.3-volt signal and LOW will send a 0-volt
                          signal. If you output completes the circuit (and
                          the device powers on) when a 3.3-volt signal is
                          sent, then set this to HIGH. If the device
                          powers when a 0-volt signal is sent, set this to
                          LOW.

  WiringPi Pin            This is the GPIO that will be the signal to the
                          output, using WiringPi numbering.

  Protocol                This is the protocol to use to transmit via
                          433MHz. Default is 1, but if this doesn’t work,
                          increment the number.

  Pulse Length            This is the pulse length to transmit via 433MHz.
                          Default is 189 ms.

  Bit Length              This is the bit length to transmit via 433MHz.
                          Default is 24-bit.

  On Command              This is the command used to turn the output on.
                          For wireless relays, this is the numerical
                          command to be transmitted, and for command
                          outputs this is the command to be executed.

  Off Command             This is the command used to turn the output off.
                          For wireless relays, this is the numerical
                          command to be transmitted, and for command
                          outputs this is the command to be executed.

  PWM Command             This is the command used to set the duty cycle.
                          The string “((duty_cycle))” in the command will
                          be replaced with the actual duty cycle before
                          the command is executed. Ensure “((duty_cycle))”
                          is included in your command for this feature to
                          work correctly.

  Current Draw (amps)     The is the amount of current the device powered
                          by the output draws. Note: this value should be
                          calculated based on the voltage set in the
                          Output Usage Settings.

  Start State             This specifies whether the output should be ON
                          or OFF when mycodo initially starts. Wireless
                          relays have an additional option ‘Neither’ which
                          will not issue an on or off command when Mycodo
                          starts or stops.

  Seconds to turn On      This is a way to turn a output on for a specific
                          duration of time. This can be useful for testing
                          the outputs and powered devices or the measured
                          effects a device may have on an environmental
                          condition.

Function

Functions couple Inputs with Outputs to perform specific tasks. For
example, this could be regulation of temperature with a temperature
sensor and heater with a PID Controller.

PID Controller

A proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller is a control loop
feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It
efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a
desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and
oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint
quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little
oscillation.

PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new
settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the
controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller
resumes operation.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Activate/Deactivate     Turn a particular PID controller on or off.

  Pause                   When paused, the control variable will not be
                          updated and the PID will not turn on the
                          associated outputs. Settings can be changed
                          without losing current PID output values.

  Hold                    When held, the control variable will not be
                          updated but the PID will turn on the associated
                          outputs, Settings can be changed without losing
                          current PID output values.

  Resume                  Resume a PID controller from being held or
                          paused.

  Setpoint                This is the specific point you would like the
                          environment to be regaulted at. For example, if
                          you would like the humidity regulated to 60%,
                          enter 60.

  Band (+/- Setpoint)     Hysteresis option. If set to a non-0 value, the
                          setpoint will become a band, which will be
                          between the band_max=setpoint+band and
                          band_min=setpoint-band. If Raising, the PID will
                          raise above band_max, then wait until the
                          condition falls below band_min to resume
                          regulation. If Lowering, the PID will lower
                          below band_min, then wait until the condition
                          rises above band_max to resume regulating. If
                          set to Both, regulation will only occur to the
                          outside min and max of the band, and cease when
                          within the band. Set to 0 to disable Hysteresis.

  Store Lower as Negative Checking this will store all output variables
                          (PID and output duration/duty cycle) as a
                          negative values in the measurement database.
                          This is useful for displaying graphs that
                          indicate whether the PID is currently lowering
                          or raising. Disable this if you desire all
                          positive values to be stored in the measurement
                          database.

  Direction               This is the direction that you wish to regulate.
                          For example, if you only require the temperature
                          to be raised, set this to “Up,” but if you
                          require regulation up and down, set this to
                          “Both.”

  Period                  This is the duration between when the PID
                          acquires a measurement, the PID is updated, and
                          the output is modulated.

  Max Age                 The time (in seconds) that the sensor
                          measurement age is required to be less than. If
                          the measurement is not younger than this age,
                          the measurement is thrown out and the PID will
                          not actuate the output. This is a safety measure
                          to ensure the PID is only using recent
                          measurements.

  Raise Output            This is the output that will cause the
                          particular environmental condition to rise. In
                          the case of raising the temperature, this may be
                          a heating pad or coil.

  Min Duration (raise)    This is the minimum that the PID output must be
                          before the Up Output turns on. If the PID output
                          exceeds this minimum, the Up Output will turn on
                          for the PID output number of seconds.

  Max Duration (raise)    This is the maximum duration the Up Output is
                          allowed to turn on for. If the PID output
                          exceeds this number, the Up Output will turn on
                          for no greater than this duration of time.

  Lower Output            This is the output that will cause the
                          particular environmental condition to lower. In
                          the case of lowering the CO2, this may be an
                          exhaust fan.

  Min Duration (lower)    This is the minimum that the PID output must be
                          before the Down Output turns on. If the PID
                          output exceeds this minimum, the Down Output
                          will turn on for the PID output number of
                          seconds.

  Max Duration (lower)    This is the maximum duration the Down Output is
                          allowed to turn on for. if the PID output
                          exceeds this number, the Down Output will turn
                          on for no greater than this duration of time.

  KP                      Proportional coefficient (non-negative).
                          Accounts for present values of the error. For
                          example, if the error is large and positive, the
                          control output will also be large and positive.

  KI                      Integral coefficient (non-negative). Accounts
                          for past values of the error. For example, if
                          the current output is not sufficiently strong,
                          the integral of the error will accumulate over
                          time, and the controller will respond by
                          applying a stronger action.

  KD                      Derivative coefficient (non-negative). Accounts
                          for predicted future values of the error, based
                          on its current rate of change.

  Integrator Min          The minimum allowed integrator value, for
                          calculating Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki *
                          integrator; and PID output = Kp_total + Ki_total
                          + Kd_total)

  Integrator Max          The maximum allowed integrator value, for
                          calculating Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki *
                          integrator; and PID output = Kp_total + Ki_total
                          + Kd_total)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conditional Statements

A conditional statement is a way to perform certain actions based on
whether a condition is true. Conditional statements can be created for
both inputs and outputs. Possible conditional statements include:

-   If Output #1 turns ON, turn Output #3 ON
-   If Output #1 turns ON, turn Output #4 ON for 40 seconds and notify
    critical-issue@domain.com
-   If Output #1 turns ON for any duration, turn Output #4 ON
-   If Output #4 turns ON for 21 seconds, turn Output #5 ON for 50
    seconds
-   If Output #4 turns ON for 20 seconds, turn Output #1 OFF
-   If Humidity is Greater Than 80%, turn Output #4 ON for 40 seconds
-   If Humidity if Less Than 50%, turn Output #1 ON for 21 seconds,
    execute ‘/usr/local/bin/script.sh’, and notify email@domain.com
-   If Temperature if Greater Than 35 C, deactivate PID #1

Before activating any conditional statements or PID controllers, it’s
advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a
configuration that eliminates conflicts. Then, trial run your
configuration before connecting devices to the outputs. Some devices or
outputs may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid
succession. Therefore, avoid creating an infinite loop with conditional
statements.

Measurement Conditional Statement If Options

Check if the latest measurement is above or below the set value.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  If Measurement          The measurement that will be checked every
                          Period. By default, a measurement will only be
                          checked for in the past 120 seconds, unless
                          “None Found Last x seconds” in which case the
                          Value will determine the measurement age. The
                          takeaway from this is if a measurement is more
                          than 120 seconds

  If State                The conditional will trigger if the measurement
                          Greater Than or Less Than the set If Value, or
                          if “No Measurement” is set and the measurement
                          age is greater than Max Age.

  If Value                The value that the measurement will be checked
                          against (greater or less than).

  Period (seconds)        The period (seconds) between conditional checks.

  Refractory Period       The minimum duration (seconds) to wait after a
  (seconds)               conditional has been triggered to begin
                          evaluating the conditional again.

  Max Age (seconds)       The maximum age the measurement can be. If a
                          measurement isn’t available within this time
                          frame, the conditional will not trigger. The
                          only exception is if “If State” is set to “No
                          Measurement”, which will cause the conditional
                          to trigger when there is no measurement
                          available (indicating the input or measuring
                          device has stopped working).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Conditional Statement If Options

Monitor the state of an output.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  If Output               The Output to monitor for a change of state.

  If State                If the state of the output changes to On or Off
                          the conditional will trigger. If “On (any
                          duration) is selected, th trigger will occur no
                          matter how long the output turns on for, whereas
                          if only”On" is selected, the conditional will
                          trigger only when the output turns on for a
                          duration of time equal to the set “Duration
                          (seconds)”.

  If Duration (seconds)   If “On” is selected, a optional duration
                          (seconds) may be set that will trigger the
                          conditional only if the Output is turned on for
                          this specific duration.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edge Conditional Statement If Options

                          state is detected, either Rising when the state
                          changes from LOW (0 volts) to HIGH (3.5 volts)
                          or Falling when the state changes from HIGH (3.3
                          volts) to LOW (0 volts), or Both (Rising and
                          Falling).

Conditional Statement variables

Commands that are executed by conditional statements can now include
variables. To use, just place the variable name, including “((” and “))”
in your command, and it will be replaced with the variable’s value
before execution. See the tables below for the currently-supported
variables.

It is recommended to output a test string to a text file to verify the
output is as expected, with a command such as the following (for a
Conditional using the Raspberry Pi CPU temperature Input as the
measurement):

    echo "TEST: ((measure_temperature)), ((measure_location)), ((measure_period))" > /home/mycodo/test_measure.txt

Or for an Output Conditional:

    echo "TEST: ((output_pin)), ((output_action)), ((output_duration)), ((output_pwm))" > /home/mycodo/test_output.txt

Measurement Conditional command variables

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Variable                          Description
  --------------------------------- --------------------------------------
  ((measure_location))              Input location (such as GPIO pin, I2C

Methods

More -> Methods

Methods enable Setpoint Tracking in PIDs and time-based duty cycle
changes in timers. Normally, a PID controller will regulate an
environmental condition to a specific setpoint. If you would like the
setpoint to change over time, this is called setpoint tracking. Setpoint
Tracking is useful for applications such as reflow ovens, thermal
cyclers (DNA replication), mimicking natural daily cycles, and more.
Methods may also be used to change a duty cycle over time when used with
a Timer.

Universal Options

These options are shared with several method types.

  Setting            Description
  ------------------ -----------------------------------------------------
  Start Time/Date    This is the start time of a range of time.
  End Time/Date      This is the end time of a range of time.
  Start Setpoint     This is the start setpoint of a range of setpoints.
  End Setpoint       This is the end setpoint of a range of setpoints.

Specific Method Options

Time/Date Method

A time/date method allows a specific time/date span to dictate the
setpoint. This is useful for long-running methods, that may take place
over the period of days, weeks, or months.

Duration Method

A Duration Method allows a _SETPOINT_ (for PIDs) or _DUTY CYCLE_ (for
Timers) to be set after specific durations of time. Each new duration
added will stack, meaning it will come after the previous duration,
meaning a newly-added _START SETPOINT_ will begin after the previous
entry’s _END SETPOINT_.

If the “Repeat Method” option is used, this will cause the method to
repeat once it has reached the end. If this option is used, no more
durations may be added to the method. If the repeat option is deleted
then more durations may be added. For instance, if your method is 200
seconds total, if the Repeat Duration is set to 600 seconds, the method
will repeat 3 times and then automatically turn off the PID or Timer.

Daily (Time-Based) Method

The daily time-based method is similar to the time/date method, however
it will repeat every day. Therefore, it is essential that only the span
of one day be set in this method. Begin with the start time at 00:00:00
and end at 23:59:59 (or 00:00:00, which would be 24 hours from the
start). The start time must be equal or greater than the previous end
time.

Daily (Sine Wave) Method

The daily sine wave method defines the setpoint over the day based on a
sinusoidal wave. The sine wave is defined by y = [A * sin(B * x + C)] +
D, where A is amplitude, B is frequency, C is the angle shift, and D is
the y-axis shift. This method will repeat daily.

Daily (Bezier Curve) Method

A daily Bezier curve method define the setpoint over the day based on a
cubic Bezier curve. If unfamiliar with a Bezier curve, it is recommended
you use the graphical Bezier curve generator and use the 8 variables it
creates for 4 points (each a set of x and y). The x-axis start (x3) and
end (x0) will be automatically stretched or skewed to fit within a
24-hour period and this method will repeat daily.



PID TUNING


Function -> PIDs


PID Control Theory

The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in
industrial settings, for it"s ability to handle both simple and complex
regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional,
integral, and derivative.

The Proportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant Kp,
to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large
proportional output.

The Integral takes the error and multiplies it by Ki, then integrates it
(Ki · 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will
continually sum it and multiply it by the constant Ki. The integral is
used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using Kp alone
produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor
measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the
output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.

The Derivative multiplies the error by Kd, then differentiates it (Kd ·
s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will
change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path
becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of
dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the
measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and
the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the
desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or
too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the
three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated
Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much
each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a
gain (represented by _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_). By adjusting the gains, the
sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths
are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path
does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned
off.

The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was
designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This
feedback loop, with a _properly tuned_ PID controller, can achieve a set
point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little
oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.

Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a
temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and
cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value
would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would
rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a
lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the
error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the
temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be
acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative
output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the
temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would
normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can
be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.

Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_
can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance,
the _KI_ and _KD_ can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and
producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the
PI controller. It is recommended to start with only _KP_ activated, then
experiment with _KP_ and _KI_, before finally using all three. Because
systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the
degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need
to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.


Quick Setup Examples

These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation
in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure
your _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_ gains. There are a number of online resources
that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to
determine ideal PID values (such as here, here, here, here, and here)
and since there are no universal values that will work for every system,
it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the
variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively
implement them.

Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my
setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of _KP_ = 30, _KI_ =
1.0, and _KD_ = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of _KP_ =
1.0, _KI_ = 0.2, and _KD_ = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have
been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental
chamber.


Exact Temperature Regulation

This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a
certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that
cools).

Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each
sensor and activate the sensor.

Add two outputs, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.

Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change _Setpoint_ to
the desired temperature, _Regulate Direction_ to “Both”. Set _Raise
Output_ to the relay attached to the heating device and the _Lower
Relay_ to the relay attached to the cooling device.

Set _KP_ = 1, _KI_ = 0, and _KD_ = 0, then activate the PID.

If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should
activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the
temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than
the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate
until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is
not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase
the _KP_ value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with
different configurations involving only _Read Interval_ and _KP_ to
achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the _KI_ and _KD_ from 0 until
a working regulation is achieved with _KP_ alone.

View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the
temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by
well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and
tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the
proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with
little oscillation around the Setpoint.

Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing _KP_ slightly (~25%)
and increasing _KI_ by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower,
0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates.
Slowly increase _KI_ until regulation becomes both quick and with little
oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with
experimenting with the system and the _KD_ value can be experimented
with once both _KP_ and _KI_ have been tuned.


High Temperature Regulation

Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed.
For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the
system and only up-regulation can be used.

Use the same configuration as the Exact Temperature Regulation example,
except change _Regulate Direction_ to “Raise” and do not touch the “Down
Relay” section.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Live Measurements

Info -> Live Measurements

The Live Measurements page is the first page a user sees after logging
in to Mycodo. It will display the current measurements being acquired
from Input and Math controllers. If there is nothing displayed on the
Live Measurements page, ensure an Input or Math controller is both
configured correctly and activated. Data will be automatically updated
on the page from the measurement database.


Asynchronous Graphs

Info -> Asynchronous Graphs

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning
relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be
very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Live Graph. Select a
time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists.
The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every
view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700
data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be
created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables
much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4
months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded.
However, when viewing a 4 month span, it’s not possible to see every
data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is
inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what
you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only
~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which
time only another ~50kb is downloaded.

Note: Live Graphs require measurements to be acquired, therefore at
least one sensor needs to be added and activated in order to display
live data.


Export-Import

More -> Export Import

Measurements that fall within the selected date/time frame may be
exported as CSV with their corresponding timestamps.

Additionally, the entire measurement database (influxdb) may be exported
as a ZIP file backup. This ZIP may be imported back in any Mycodo system
to restore these measurements. Note that an import will override the
current data (i.e. destroying it).

Mycodo settings may be exported as a ZIP file containing the Mycodo
settings database (sqlite). This ZIP file may be used to restore the
settings database to another Mycodo install, as long as the Mycodo
version and database versions are the same. Future support for
installing older (or newer) databases and performing an automatic
upgrade/downgrade is in the works.


Dependencies

[Gear Icon] -> Dependencies

The dependency page allows viewing of dependency information and the
ability to initiate their installation.

During the installation of Mycodo, there is an option to select which
dependencies to install. If “Minimal Install” or “Custom Install” was
selected (rather than “Full Install”), there may be unmet dependencies
on your system. Don’t worry, this isn’t necessarily a problem. These
optional dependencies only need to be installed when there’s a
particular feature you want to use. When a user attempts to use a
feature that has an unmet dependency, the user will be forwarded to the
Dependency page in order to install it.


Camera

More -> Cameras

Once a cameras has been set up (in the Camera Settings), it may be used
to capture still images, create time-lapses, and stream video. Cameras
may also be used by Conditional Statements to trigger a camera image or
video capture (as well as the ability to email the image/video with a
notification).


Output Usage

More -> Output Usage

Output usage statistics are calculated for each output, based on how
long the output has been powered, the current draw of the device
connected to the output, and other Relay Usage Settings.


Backup-Restore

[Gear Icon] -> Backup Restore

A backup is made to /var/Mycodo-backups when the system is upgraded or
through the web interface on the Config -> Backup / Restore page.

If you need to restore a backup, this can be done on the Config ->
Backup / Restore page. Find the backup you would like restored and press
the Restore button beside it. A restore can also be initialized through
the command line. Use the following commands to initialize a restore,
changing the appropriate directory names, ‘user’ to your user name, and
TIME and COMMIT to the appropriate text found as the directory names in
/var/Mycodo-backups/

    sudo mv /home/user/Mycodo /home/user/Mycodo_old
    sudo cp -a /var/Mycodo-backups/Mycodo-TIME-COMMIT /home/user/Mycodo
    sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_post.sh


System Information

[Gear Icon] -> System Information

This page serves to provide information about the Mycodo frontend and
backend as well as the linux system it’s running on. Several commands
and their output are listed to give the user information about how their
system is running.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command                 Description
  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Mycodo Version          The current version of Mycodo, reported by the
                          configuration file.

  Python Version          The version of python currently running the web
                          user interface.

  Database Version        The current version of the settings database. If
                          the current version is different from what it
                          should be, an error will appear indicating the
                          issue and a link to find out more information
                          about the issue.

  Daemon Status           This will be a green “Running” or a red
                          “Stopped”. Additionally, the Mycodo version and
                          hostname text at the top-left of the screen May
                          be Green, Yellow, or Red to indicate the status.
                          Green = daemon running, yellow = unable to
                          connect, and red = daemon not running.

  …                       Several other status indicators and commands are
                          listed to provide information about the health
                          of the system. Use these in addition to others
                          to investigate software or hardware issues.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------



TROUBLESHOOTING


Daemon Not Running

-   Check the Logs: From the Configure [Gear Icon] -> Mycodo Logs page,
    check the Daemon Log for any errors. If the issue began after an
    upgrade, also check the Upgrade Log for indications of an issue.
-   Determine if the Daemon is Running: Execute
    ps aux | grep '/var/mycodo-root/env/bin/python /var/mycodo-root/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py'
    in a terminal and look for an entry to be returned. If nothing is
    returned, the daemon is not running.
-   Daemon Lock File: If the daemon is not running, make sure the daemon
    lock file is deleted at /var/lock/mycodo.pid. The daemon cannot
    start if the lock file is present.
-   If a solution could not be found after investigating the above
    suggestions, submit a New Mycodo Issue on github.


Incorrect Database Version

-   Check the System Information page (from the web UI: select [Gear
    Icon] -> System Information or select the mycodo logo in
    the top-left).
-   An incorrect database version error means the version stored in the
    Mycodo settings database (~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db) is not
    correct for the latest version of Mycodo, determined in the Mycodo
    config file (~/Mycodo/mycodo/config.py).
-   This can be caused by an error in the upgrade process from an older
    database version to a newer version, or from a database that did not
    upgrade during the Mycodo upgrade process.
-   Check the Upgrade Log for any issues that may have occurred. The log
    is located at /var/log/mycodo/mycodoupgrade.log but may also be
    accessed from the web UI (if you’re able to): select [Gear Icon] ->
    Mycodo Logs -> Upgrade Log.
-   Sometimes issues may not immediately present themselves. It is not
    uncommon to be experiencing a database issue that was actually
    introduced several Mycodo versions ago, before the latest upgrade.
-   Because of the nature of how many versions the database can be in,
    correcting a database issue may be very difficult. It may be much
    easier to delete your database and let Mycodo generate a new one.
-   Use the following commands to rename your database and restart the
    web UI. If both commands are successful, refresh your web UI page in
    your browser in order to generate a new database and create a new
    Admin user.

    mv ~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db ~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db.backup
    sudo service mycodoflask restart

  MAX31855K: Temperature link

  MAX31856: Temperature link

  MAX31865: Temperature link

  MH-Z19: Carbon dioxide (CO2) in ppmv link

This documentation provides specific installation procedures for
configuring UART with the Raspberry Pi version 1 or 2.

The K30 may be tested by executing
~/Mycodo/mycodo/tests/manual_tests/test_uart_K30.py

For Atlas Scientific sensors, this guide may be used, as well as the
above K-30 guide, to set up UART on the Raspberry Pi 1 and 2. However,
for Pi 3s, use the procedure below.

Because the UART is handled differently by the Raspberry Pi 3, from of
the addition of bluetooth, there are a different set of instructions. If
installing Mycodo on a Raspberry Pi 3, you only need to perform these
steps to configure UART:

Run raspi-config

sudo raspi-config

Go to Advanced Options -> Serial and disable. Then edit /boot/config.txt

sudo vi /boot/config.txt

Find the line “enable_uart=0” and change it to “enable_uart=1”, then
reboot.


I2C

The I2C interface should be enabled with raspi-config.

Edge Detection

The detection of a changing signal, for instance a simple switch
completing a circuit, requires the use of edge detection. By detecting a
rising edge (LOW to HIGH), a falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both,
actions or events can be triggered. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal
should be equipped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the
GPIO up [to 5-volts] or down [to ground]. The option to enable the
internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety
reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low.

Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple
switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect
sensors, float switches, and more.


I2C Multiplexers

All devices that connected to the Raspberry Pi by the I2C bus need to
have a unique address in order to communicate. Some inputs may have the
same address (such as the AM2315), which prevents more than one from
being connected at the same time. Others may provide the ability to
change the address, however the address range may be limited, which
limits by how many you can use at the same time. I2C multiplexers are
extremely clever and useful in these scenarios because they allow
multiple sensors with the same I2C address to be connected.

Multiplexers can be set up by loading a kernel driver to handle the
communication, producing a new I2C bus device for each multiplexer
channel. To enable the driver for the TCA9548A/PCA9548A, visit
GPIO-pca9548 to get the code and latest install instructions. If
successfully set up, there will be 8 new I2C busses on the
Config -> System Information page.

The driver for the TCA9545A can be found at
https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a and other drivers are
available elsewhere. See the manufacturer or user forums for details.
Some multiplexers I’ve tested are below.

  TCA9548A/PCA9548A: I2C Multiplexer link (I2C): Has 8 selectable
  addresses, so 8 multiplexers can be connected to one Raspberry Pi.
  Each multiplexer has 8 channels, allowing up to 8 devices/sensors with
  the same address to be connected to each multiplexer. 8 multiplexers x
  8 channels = 64 devices/sensors with the same I2C address.

  TCA9545A: I2C Bus Multiplexer link (I2C): This board also creates 4
  new I2C busses, but each with their own selectable voltage, either 3.3
  or 5.0 volts.


Analog-to-Digital Converters

An analog to digital converter (ADC) allows the use of any analog sensor
that outputs a variable voltage. A voltage divider may be necessary to
attain your desired range.

  ADS1x15: Analog-to-digital converter link

  MCP3008: Analog-to-digital converter link

  MCP342x: Analog-to-digital converter link

Notes

From
[@Theoi-Meteoroi](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/315#issuecomment-344798815)
on GitHub:

I figured out why this [AM2315] sensor is unreliable with Rpi3 hardware
I2C. It is among a number of I2C devices that really hates the BCM2835
clock stretching blunder (hardware bug: raspberrypi/linux#254). The
wakeup attempts fail, consistently. I checked the bitstream with a
sniffer, and see that the sensor may respond once out of 20 or so tries
(or not at all) but only with a single byte returned. The solution is to
use a software implementation of the I2C bus. You need to add pull-up
resistors (4.7k is dandy) to 3.3v and install the i2c_gpio device
overlay. Seems to work fine now, will run for a few days, but the CRC
failures are gone and I get good readings, every time. And no twiddling
the power for the sensor is required.

To enable software I2C, add the following line to your /boot/config.txt

dtoverlay=i2c-gpio,i2c_gpio_sda=23,i2c_gpio_scl=24,i2c_gpio_delay_us=4

After rebooting, a new I2C bus at /dev/i2c-3 should exist with SDA on
pin 23 (BCM) and SCL on pin 24 (BCM). Make sure you add the appropriate
pull-up resistors before connecting any devices.
