ABOUT MYCODO


Mycodo is a remote monitoring and automated regulation system with a
focus on modulating environmental conditions. It was built to run on the
Raspberry Pi (versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3) and aims to be easy to install
and set up.

The core system coordinates a diverse set of responses to sensor
measurements, including actions such as camera captures, email
notifications, relay activation/deactivation, regulation with PID
control, and more. Mycodo has been used for cultivating gourmet
mushrooms, cultivating plants, culturing microorganisms, maintaining
honey bee apiary homeostasis, incubating snake eggs and young animals,
aging cheeses, fermenting foods, maintaining aquatic systems, and more.

A proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller is a control loop
feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It
efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a
desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and
oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint
quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little
oscillation.



FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


_Where do I even begin?_

Here is how I generally set up Mycodo to monitor and regulate:

1.  Determine what environmental condition you want to measure
    or regulate. Consider the devices that must be coupled to
    achieve this. For instance, temperature regulation require a
    temperature sensor as the input and an electric heater as
    the output.
2.  Determine what relays you will need to power your electric devices.
    The Raspberry Pi is capable of directly switching relays (using a
    3.3-volt signal), although opto-isolating the circuit is advisable.
    Be careful when selecting a relay not to exceed the current draw of
    the Raspberry Pi’s PGIO.
3.  See the Device Specific Information for information about what
    sensors are supported. Acquire one or more of these sensors and
    relays and connect them to the Raspberry Pi according to the
    manufacturer’s instructions.
4.  On the Input page, create a new input using the dropdown to select
    the correct sensor or input device. Configure the input with the
    correct communication pins and other options. Activate the input to
    begin recording measurements to the database..
5.  Go to the Data -> Live Measurements page to ensure there is recent
    data being acquired from the input.
6.  On the Ouput -> Devices page, add a relay and configure the GPIO pin
    that switches it, whether the relay switches On when the signal is
    HIGH or LOW, and what state (On or Off) to set the relay when
    Mycodo starts. A pulse-width modulated (PWM) output may also
    be used..
7.  Test the relay by switching it On and Off or generating a PWM signal
    from the Output -> Devices page and make sure the device connected
    to the relay turns On when you select “On”, and Off when you select
    “Off”.
8.  On the PID -> PID Controllers page, create a PID controller with the
    appropriate input, output, and other parameters.
9.  On the Data -> Live Graphs page, create a graph that includes the
    input measurement, the output that is being used by the PID, and the
    PID setpoint. This provides a good visualization for tuning the PID.
    See Quick Setup Examples for tuning tips.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_How do I add an input (like a sensor) to the system that’s not
currently supported?_

Currently, adding the ability to receive input that’s not currently
supported to the system involves editing several files. There has been
effort to make the addition process as simple as possible. See the
Adding Support for a New Input Wiki page for how to do this.

An alternate way to add an input is to create a linux script that
obtains and returns a value when executed, then add a new input with the
“Linux Command” option. This will periodically execute the command and
store the returned value to the database for use with the rest of the
Mycodo system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Can I variably control the speed of motors or other devices with the
PWM output signal from the PID?_

Yes, as long as you have the proper hardware to do that. The PWM signal
being produced by the PID should be handled appropriately, whether by a
fast-switching solid state relay, an AC modulation ciruit, or something
else.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_What should I do if I have an issue?_

First, read the manual to make sure you understand how the system works
and you’re using the system properly. ALso check out the Wiki. You may
even want to look through recent Issues. If you haven’t resolved your
issue by this point, make a New Issue describing the issue and attaching
a sufficient amount of evidence (screenshots, log files, etc.) to aid
diagnostics.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------


Output Usage Settings

In order to calculate accurate output usage statistics, a few
characteristics of your electrical system needs to be know. These
variables should describe the characteristics of the electrical system
being used by the relays to operate electrical devices. Note: Proper
output usage calculations also rely on the correct current draw to be
set for each output (see Output Settings).

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting               Description
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  Max Amps              Set the maximum allowed amperage to be switched
                        on at any given time. If a output that’s
                        instructed to turn on will cause the sum of
                        active devices to exceed this amount, the
                        output will not be allowed to turn on, to
                        prevent any damage that may result from
                        exceeding current limits.

  Voltage               Alternating current (AC) voltage that is
                        switched by the outputs. This is usually 120 or
                        240.

  Cost per kWh          This is how much you pay per kWh.

  Currency Unit         This is the unit used for the currency that
                        pays for electricity.

  Day of Month          This is the day of the month (1-30) that the
                        electricity meter is read (which will
                        correspond to the electrical bill).
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------


Users

Mycodo requires at least one Admin user for the login system to be
enabled. If there isn’t an Admin user, the web server will redirect to
an Admin Creation Form. This is the first page you see when starting
Mycodo for the first time. After an Admin user has been created,
additional users may be created from the User Settings page.

  Role                  Roles are a way of imposing access restrictions
                        on users, to either allow or deny actions. See
                        the table below for explanations of the four
                        default Roles.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------


User Roles

Roles define the permissions of each user. There are 4 default roles
that determine if a user can view or edit particular areas of Mycodo.
Four roles are provided by default, but custom roles may be created.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------


Camera Settings

Many cameras can be used simultaneously with Mycodo. Each camera needs
to be set up in the camera settings, then may be used throughout the
software. Note that not every option (such as Hue or White Balance) may
be able to be used with your particular camera, due to manufacturer
differences in hardware and software.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting               Description
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  Type                  Select whether the camera is a Raspberry Pi
                        Camera or a USB camera.

  Library               Select which library to use to communicate with
                        the camera. The Raspberry Pi Camera uses
                        picamera (and potentially opencv), and USB
                        cameras should be set to opencv.

  OpenCV Device         Any devices detected by opencv will populate
                        this dropdown list. If there are no values in
                        this list, none were detected. If you have
                        multiple opencv devices detected, try setting
                        the camera to each device and take a photo to
                        determine which camera is associated with which
                        device.

  Output ID             This output will turn on during the capture of
                        any still image (which includes timelapses).

CONTROLLERS


Controllers are essentially modules that can be used to perform
functions or communicate with other parts of Mycodo. Each controller
performs a specific task or group of related tasks. There are also
Controller Functions, which are larger functions of a controller or
controllers and have been given their own sections.


Input

Inputs (such as sensors or analog signals) measure environmental and
other characteristic conditions, which will be stored in an influxdb
round-robin database. This database will provide recent measurements for
Graphs, LCDs, PID Controllers, Conditional Statements, and other parts
of Mycodo to operate from.

Among the sensors is ‘Linux Command’. This is a way to use a custom
script to return a value to be used within Mycodo, without having to
edit the Mycodo code. Merely create your script and use this sensor to
have the return value of the script be stored in the Mycodo database for
use with PIDs and other parts of Mycodo that uses sensor measurements.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting               Description
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  Activate              After the sensor has been properly configured,
                        activation begins acquiring measurements from
                        the sensor. Any activated conditional
                        statements will now being operating.

  Deactivate            Deactivation stops measurements from being
                        acquired from the sensor. All associated
                        conditional statements will cease to operate.

  Save                  Save the current configuration entered into the
                        input boxes for a particular sensor.

  Delete                Delete a particular sensor.

  Up/Down               Move a particular sensor up or down in the
                        order displayed.

  Power Output          Select a output that powers the sensor. This
                        enables powering cycling (turn off then on)
                        when the sensor returns 3 consecutive errors to
                        attempt to fix the issue. Transistors may also
                        be used instead of a relay (note: NPN
                        transistors are preferred over PNP for powering
                        sensors).

  Location              Depending on what sensor is being used, you
                        will need to either select a serial number
                        (DS18B20 temperature sensor), a GPIO pin (in
                        the case of sensors read by a GPIO), or an I2C
                        address. and channel if using the TCA9548A I2C
                        multiplexer.

  I2C Bus               The bus to be used to communicate with the I2C
                        address. If you’re using an I2C multiplexer
                        that provides multiple buses, this allows you
                        to select which bus the sensor is connected to.

  Period                After the sensor is successfully read and a
                        database entry is made, this is the duration of
                        time waited until the sensor is measured again.

  Pre Output            If you require a output to be activated before
                        a measurement is made (for instance, if you
                        have a pump that extracts air to a chamber
                        where the sensor resides), this is the output
                        number that will be activated. The output will
                        be activated for a duration defined by the Pre
                        Duration, then once the output turns off, a
                        measurement by the sensor is made.

  Pre Output Duration   This is the duration of time that the Pre
                        Output runs for before the sensor measurement
                        is obtained.

  Command               A linux command (executed as the user ‘mycodo’)
                        that the return value becomes the measurement

  Command Measurement   The measured condition (e.g. temperature,
                        humidity, etc.) from the linux command

  Command Units         The units of the measurement condition from the
                        linux command

  Edge                  Edge sensors only: Select whether the Rising or
                        Falling (or both) edges of a changing voltage
                        are detected. A number of devices to do this
                        when in-line with a circuit supplying a
                        3.3-volt input signal to a GPIO, such as simple
                        mechanical switch, a button, a magnet
                        (reed/hall) sensor, a PIR motion detector, and
                        more.

  Bounce Time (ms)      Edge sensors only: This is the number of
                        milliseconds to bounce the input signal. This
                        is commonly called debouncing a signal. and may
                        be necessary if using a mechanical circuit.

  Reset Period          Edge sensors only: This is the period of time
                        after an edge detection that another edge will
                        not be recorded. This enables devices such as
                        PIR motion sensors that may stay activated for
                        longer periods of time.

  Multiplexer (MX)      If connected to the TCA9548A I2C multiplexer,
                        select what the I2C address of the multiplexer
                        is.

  Mx I2C Bus            If connected to the TCA9548A I2C multiplexer,
                        select the I2C bus the multiplexer is connected
                        to.

  Mx Channel            If connected to the TCA9548A I2C multiplexer,
                        select the channel of the multiplexer the
                        device is connected to.

  Measurement           Analog-to-digital converter only: The type of
                        measurement being acquired by the ADC. For
                        instance, if the resistance of a photocell is
                        being measured through a voltage divider, this
                        measurement would be “light”.

  Units                 Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the
                        unit of the measurement. With the above example

                        “lux” or “intensity”.

  Channel               Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the

                        minimum voltage to use when scaling to produce
                        the unit value for the database. For instance,
                        if your ADC is not expected to measure below
                        0.2 volts for your particular circuit, set this
                        to “0.2”.

  Volts Max             Analog-to-digital converter only: This is
                        similar to the Min option above, however it is
                        setting the ceiling to the voltage range. Units

                        produce a unit output. For instance, if your
                        voltage range is 0.0 - 1.0 volts, and the unit
                        range is 1 - 60, and a voltage of 0.5 is
                        measured, in addition to 0.5 being stored in
                        the database, 30 will be stored as well. This
                        enables creating calibrated scales to use with
                        your particular circuit.

Sensor Verification

Sensor verification was introduced in an earlier version and was broken
when the system moved to its new software framework. It was a great
feature, and it’s planned to be integrated into the latest version.

This allows the verification of a sensor’s measurement with another
sensor’s measurement. This feature is best utilized when you have two
sensors in the same location (ideally as close as possible). One sensor
(host) should be set up to use the other sensor (slave) to verify. The
host sensor should be used to operate the PID, as one feature of the
verification is the ability to disable the PID if the difference between
measurements is not within the range specified.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting               Description
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  GPIO                  This is the sensor that will be used to verify
                        the sensor measurement. The sensor will be read
                        directly after the first sensor’s measurement
                        to verify whether the sensors have similar
                        measurements.

  Difference            This is the maximum measured measurement
                        difference between the two sensors before an
                        action is triggered (either notify by email or
                        prevent PID from operating; more below).

  Notification          If the measurements of the two sensors differ
                        by more than the set _Difference_, an email
                        will be sent to the address in the
                        _Notification_ field.

  Stop PID              If the measurements of the two sensors differ
                        by more than the set _Difference_, the PID
                        controller will turn off.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------


Output

Outputs are various signals that can be generated that operate devices.
An output can be a PWM signal, a simple HIGH/LOW signal to operate a
relay, or a 433MHz signal to switch a radio frequency-operated relay, or
an execution of a command on the linux system Mycodo runs on.

PWM

Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique used to encode a
message into a pulsing signal, at a specific frequency in Hertz (Hz).
The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled
by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate.
The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the
total power supplied to the load.

The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect
the load (the device that uses the power), which is to say that the
resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible.
The rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary
greatly depending on load and application, for example

  Switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove;
  120 Hz in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz
  for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio
  amplifiers and computer power supplies.

The term duty cycle describes the proportion of ‘on’ time to the regular
interval or ‘period’ of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power,
because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed
in percent, 100% being fully on.

Currently, PWM is very new in Mycodo and does not have many features.
PWM pins can be set up in the Output -> Devices page, then it may be
used by a PWM PID Controller.

  Library               Select the method for producing the PWM signal.
                        Hardware pins can produce up to a 30 MHz PWM
                        signal, while any other (non-hardware PWM) pin
                        can produce up to a 40 kHz PWM signal. See the
                        table, below, for the hardware pins on various
                        Pi boards.

                        Output Usage Settings.

Non-hardware PWM Pins

If using any non-hardware PWM pin (see table below for hardware PWM
pins), then there are only certain frequencies that can be used. These
frequencies are 40000, 20000, 10000, 8000, 5000, 4000, 2500, 2000, 1600,
1250, 1000, 800, 500, 400, 250, 200, 100, and 50 Hz. If you attempt to
set a frequency that is not listed here, the nearest frequency from this
list will be used.

Hardware PWM Pins

The exact frequency may be set when using a hardware PWM pin. The same
PWM channel is available on multiple GPIO. The latest frequency and duty
cycle setting will be used by all GPIO pins which share a PWM channel.

Relays

Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small
voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger
voltage, without exposing the low-voltage system to the dangers of the
higher voltage.

Add and configure outputs in the Output tab. Outputs must be properly
set up before PID regulation can be achieved.

Wired

To set up a wired relay, set the “GPIO Pin” to the BCM GPIO number of
each pin that activates each relay. _On Trigger_ should be set to the
signal that activates the relay (the device attached to the relay turns
on). If your relay activates when the potential across the coil is
0-volts, set _On Trigger_ to “Low”, otherwise if your relay activates
when the potential across the coil is 3.3-volts (or whatever switching
voltage you are using, if not being driven by the GPIO pin), set it to
“High”.

Wireless

Certain 433 MHz wireless relays may be used, however you will need to
set the pin of the transmitter (using WiringPi numbering), pulse length,
bit length, protocol, on command, and off command. To determine your on
and off commands, connect a 433 MHz receiver to your Pi, then run the
receiver script, below, and press one of the buttons (either on or off)
on your remote to detect the numeric code associated with that button.

sudo ~/Mycodo/env/bin/python ~/Mycodo/mycodo/devices/wireless_433mhz_pi_switch.py

433 MHz wireless relays have been successfully tested with SMAKN 433MHz
RF Transmitters/Receivers and Etekcity Wireless Remote Control
Electrical Outlets (see Issue 88 for more information). If you have a
433 MHz transmitter/receiver and a wireless relay that does not work
with the current code (even after trying several different protocol
settings), submit a new issue with details of your hardware.

Command

Another option for output control is to execute a terminal command when
the output is turned on or off. Commands will be executed as the user
‘mycodo’.

Wireless and Command Output Note: Since the wireless protocol only
allows 1-way communication to 433 MHz devices, wireless relays are
assumed to be off until they are turned on, and therefore will appear
red (off) when added. If a wireless relay is turned off or on outside
Mycodo (by a remote, for instance), Mycodo will _NOT_ be able to
determine the state of the relay and will indicate whichever state the
relay was last. This is, if Mycodo turns the wireless relay on, and a
remote is used to turn the relay off, Mycodo will still assume the relay
is on.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting               Description
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  BCM Pin               This is the GPIO that will be the signal to the
                        output, using BCM numbering.

  On Trigger            This is the state of the GPIO to signal the
                        output to turn the device on. HIGH will send a
                        3.3-volt signal and LOW will send a 0-volt
                        signal. If you output completes the circuit
                        (and the device powers on) when a 3.3-volt
                        signal is sent, then set this to HIGH. If the
                        device powers when a 0-volt signal is sent, set
                        this to LOW.

  WiringPi Pin          This is the GPIO that will be the signal to the
                        output, using WireingPi numbering.

  Protocol              This is the protocol to use to transmit via
                        433MHz. Default is 1, but if this doesn’t work,
                        increment the number.

  Pulse Length          This is the pulse length to transmit via
                        433MHz. Default is 189 ms.

  Bit Length            This is the bit length to transmit via 433MHz.
                        Default is 24-bit.

  On Command            This is the command used to turn the output on.
                        For wireless relays, this is the numerical
                        command to be transmitted, and for command
                        outputs this is the command to be executed.

  Off Command           This is the command used to turn the output
                        off. For wireless relays, this is the numerical
                        command to be transmitted, and for command
                        outputs this is the command to be executed.

  Current Draw (amps)   The is the amount of current the device powered
                        by the output draws. Note: this value should be
                        calculated based on the voltage set in the
                        Output Usage Settings.

  Start State           This specifies whether the output should be ON
                        or OFF when mycodo initially starts. Wireless
                        relays have an additional option ‘Neither’
                        which will not issue an on or off command when
                        Mycodo starts or stops.

  Seconds to turn On    This is a way to turn a output on for a
                        specific duration of time. This can be useful
                        for testing the outputs and powered devices or
                        the measured effects a device may have on an
                        environmental condition.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------


PIDs

A proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller is a control loop
feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It
efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a
desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and
oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint
quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little
oscillation.

PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new
settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the
controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller
resumes operation.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting               Description
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  Activate/Deactivate   Turn a particular PID controller on or off.

  Pause                 When paused, the PID will not turn on the
                        associated outputs, and settings can be changed
                        without losing current PID output values.

  Hold                  When held, the PID will turn on the associated
                        outputs, and settings can be changed without
                        losing current PID output values.

  Resume                Resume a PID controller from being held or
                        paused.

  Setpoint              This is the specific point you would like the
                        environment to be regaulted at. For example, if
                        you would like the humidity regulated to 60%,
                        enter 60.

  Direction             This is the direction that you wish to
                        regulate. For example, if you only require the
                        temperature to be raised, set this to “Up,” but
                        if you require regulation up and down, set this
                        to “Both.”

  Period                This is the duration between when the PID
                        acquires a measurement, the PID is updated, and
                        the output is modulated.

  Max Age               The time (in seconds) that the sensor
                        measurement age is required to be less than. If
                        the measurement is not younger than this age,
                        the measurement is thrown out and the PID will
                        not actuate the output. This is a safety
                        measure to ensure the PID is only using recent
                        measurements.

  Raise Output          This is the output that will cause the
                        particular environmental condition to rise. In
                        the case of raising the temperature, this may
                        be a heating pad or coil.

  Min Duration (raise)  This is the minimum that the PID output must be
                        before the Up Output turns on. If the PID
                        output exceeds this minimum, the Up Output will
                        turn on for the PID output number of seconds.

  Max Duration (raise)  This is the maximum duration the Up Output is
                        allowed to turn on for. If the PID output
                        exceeds this number, the Up Output will turn on
                        for no greater than this duration of time.

  Lower Output          This is the output that will cause the
                        particular environmental condition to lower. In
                        the case of lowering the CO2, this may be an
                        exhaust fan.

  Min Duration (lower)  This is the minimum that the PID output must be
                        before the Down Output turns on. If the PID
                        output exceeds this minimum, the Down Output
                        will turn on for the PID output number of
                        seconds.

  Max Duration (lower)  This is the maximum duration the Down Output is
                        allowed to turn on for. if the PID output
                        exceeds this number, the Down Output will turn
                        on for no greater than this duration of time.

  KP                    Proportional coefficient (non-negative).
                        Accounts for present values of the error. For
                        example, if the error is large and positive,
                        the control output will also be large and
                        positive.

  KI                    Integral coefficient (non-negative). Accounts
                        for past values of the error. For example, if
                        the current output is not sufficiently strong,
                        the integral of the error will accumulate over
                        time, and the controller will respond by
                        applying a stronger action.

  KD                    Derivative coefficient (non-negative). Accounts
                        for predicted future values of the error, based
                        on its current rate of change.

  Integrator Min        The minimum allowed integrator value, for
                        calculating Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki *
                        integrator; and PID output = Kp_total +
                        Ki_total + Kd_total)

  Integrator Max        The maximum allowed integrator value, for
                        calculating Ki_total: (Ki_total = Ki *
                        integrator; and PID output = Kp_total +
                        Ki_total + Kd_total)

Timers

Timers enable outputs to be manipulated after specific durations of time
or at a specific times of the day. Timers will _ONLY_ do as instructed,
therefore if you turn a output _ON_ from _Start Time_ to _End Time_ and
you want that output to turn _OFF_ at the end of that period, you will
need to create another timer that turns the output _OFF_ at _End Time_ +
1 minute.

There are two types of timers, one for general outputs that turn on and
off, and those that generate a PWM signal.

General Output

For _Duration Timers_, both the on duration and the off duration can be
defined and the timer will be turned on and off for those durations
until deactivated.

For _Daily Timers_, the start hour:minute can be set to turn a specific
output on or off at the specific time of day.

PWM Method

This timer allows a method to be used to determine the duty cycle (as
percent) of a PWM output. While creating these methods, keep in mind a
duty cycle is a percentage and the values must stay between 0 and 100.


LCDs

Data may be output to a liquid crystal display (LCD) for easy viewing.
Please see LCD Displays for specific information regarding
compatibility.

There may be multiple displays created for each LCD. If there is only
one display created for the LCD, it will refresh at the set period. If
there is more than one display, it will cycle from one display to the
next every set period.

CONTROLLER FUNCTIONS


Conditional Statements

A conditional statement is a way to perform certain actions based on
whether a condition is true. Conditional statements can be created for
both inputs and outputs. Possible conditional statements include:

-   If Output #1 turns ON, turn Output #3 ON
-   If Output #1 turns ON, turn Output #4 ON for 40 seconds and notify
    critical-issue@domain.com
-   If Output #1 turns ON for any duration, turn Output #4 ON
-   If Output #4 turns ON for 21 seconds, turn Output #5 ON for 50
    seconds
-   If Output #4 turns ON for 20 seconds, turn Output #1 OFF
-   If Humidity is Greater Than 80%, turn Output #4 ON for 40 seconds
-   If Humidity if Less Than 50%, turn Output #1 ON for 21 seconds,
    execute ‘/usr/local/bin/myscript.sh’, and notify email@domain.com
-   If Temperature if Greater Than 35 C, deactivate PID #1

Before activating any conditional statements or PID controllers, it’s
advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a
configuration that eliminates conflicts. Then, trial run your
configuration before connecting devices to the outputs. Some devices or
outputs may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid
succession. Therefore, avoid creating an infinite loop with conditional
statements.

Raspberry Pi CPU temperature Input Conditional):

    echo "TEST: ((input_temperature)), ((input_location)), ((input_period))" > /home/mycodo/test_input.txt

Or for an Output Conditional:

    echo "TEST: ((output_pin)), ((output_action)), ((output_duration)), ((output_pwm))" > /home/mycodo/test_output.txt


Methods

Methods enable Setpoint Tracking in PIDs and time-based duty cycle
changes in timers. Normally, a PID controller will regulate an
environmental condition to a specific setpoint. If you would like the
setpoint to change over time, this is called setpoint tracking. Setpoint
Tracking is useful for applications such as reflow ovens, thermal
cyclers (DNA replication), mimicking natural daily cycles, and more.
Methods may also be used to change a duty cycle over time when used with
a Timer.

Universal Options

These options are shared with several method types.

  Setting           Description
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  Start Time/Date   This is the start time of a range of time.
  End Time/Date     This is the end time of a range of time.
  Start Setpoint    This is the start setpoint of a range of setpoints.
  End Setpoint      This is the end setpoint of a range of setpoints.

Specific Method Options

Time/Date Method

A time/date method allows a specific time/date span to dictate the
setpoint. This is useful for long-running methods, that may take place
over the period of days, weeks, or months.

Duration Method

A Duration Method allows a _SETPOINT_ (for PIDs) or _DUTY CYCLE_ (for
Timers) to be set after specific durations of time. Each new duration
added will stack, meaning it will come after the previous duration,
meaning a newly-added _START SETPOINT_ will begin after the previous
entry’s _END SETPOINT_.

If the “Repeat Method” option is used, this will cause the method to
repeat once it has reached the end. If this option is used, no more
durations may be added to the method. If the repeat option is deleted
then more durations may be added. For instance, if your method is 200
seconds total, if the Repeat Duration is set to 600 seconds, the method
will repeat 3 times and then automatically turn off the PID or Timer.

Daily (Time-Based) Method

The daily time-based method is similar to the time/date method, however
it will repeat every day. Therefore, it is essential that only the span
of one day be set in this method. Begin with the start time at 00:00:00
and end at 23:59:59 (or 00:00:00, which would be 24 hours from the
start). The start time must be equal or greater than the previous end
time.

Daily (Sine Wave) Method

The daily sine wave method defines the setpoint over the day based on a
sinusoidal wave. The sine wave is defined by y = [A * sin(B * x + C)] +
D, where A is amplitude, B is frequency, C is the angle shift, and D is
the y-axis shift. This method will repeat daily.

Daily (Bezier Curve) Method

A daily Bezier curve method define the setpoint over the day based on a
cubic Bezier curve. If unfamiliar with a Bezier curve, it is recommended
you use the graphical Bezier curve generator and use the 8 variables it
creates for 4 points (each a set of x and y). The x-axis start (x3) and
end (x0) will be automatically stretched or skewed to fit within a
24-hour period and this method will repeat daily.


PID Tuning

PID Control Theory

The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in
industrial settings, for it“s ability to handle both simple and complex
regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional,
integral, and derivative.

The Proportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant Kp,
to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large
proportional output.

The Integral takes the error and multiplies it by Ki, then integrates it
(Ki · 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will
continually sum it and multiply it by the constant Ki. The integral is
used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using Kp alone
produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor
measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the
output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.

The Derivative multiplies the error by Kd, then differentiates it (Kd ·
s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will
change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path
becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of
dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the
measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and
the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the
desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or
too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the
three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated
Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much
each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a
gain (represented by _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_). By adjusting the gains, the
sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths
are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path
does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned
off.

The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was
designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This
feedback loop, with a _properly tuned_ PID controller, can achieve a set
point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little
oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.

Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a
temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and
cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value
would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would
rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a
lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the
error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the
temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be
acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative
output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the
temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would
normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can
be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.

Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_
can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance,
the _KI_ and _KD_ can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and
producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the
PI controller. It is recommended to start with only _KP_ activated, then
experiment with _KP_ and _KI_, before finally using all three. Because
systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the
degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need
to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.

Quick Setup Examples

These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation
in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure
your _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_ gains. There are a number of online resources
that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to
determine ideal PID values (such as here, here, here, here, and here)
and since there are no universal values that will work for every system,
it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the
variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively
implement them.

Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my
setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of _KP_ = 30, _KI_ =
1.0, and _KD_ = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of _KP_ =
1.0, _KI_ = 0.2, and _KD_ = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have
been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental
chamber.

Exact Temperature Regulation

This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a
certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that
cools).

Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each
sensor and activate the sensor.

Add two outputs, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.

Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change _Setpoint_ to
the desired temperature, _Regulate Direction_ to “Both”. Set _Raise
Output_ to the relay attached to the heating device and the _Lower
Relay_ to the relay attached to the cooling device.

Set _KP_ = 1, _KI_ = 0, and _KD_ = 0, then activate the PID.

If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should
activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the
temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than
the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate
until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is
not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase
the _KP_ value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with
different configurations involving only _Read Interval_ and _KP_ to
achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the _KI_ and _KD_ from 0 until
a working regulation is achieved with _KP_ alone.

View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the
temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by
well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and
tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the
proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with
little oscillation around the Setpoint.

Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing _KP_ slightly (~25%)
and increasing _KI_ by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower,
0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates.
Slowly increase _KI_ until regulation becomes both quick and with little
oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with
experimenting with the system and the _KD_ value can be experimented
with once both _KP_ and _KI_ have been tuned.

High Temperature Regulation

Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed.
For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the
system and only up-regulation can be used.

Use the same configuration as the Exact Temperature Regulation example,
except change _Regulate Direction_ to “Raise” and do not touch the “Down
Relay” section.



MISCELLANEOUS


Graphs

There are two different types of graphs, Live and Asynchronous.

Live Graphs

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning
relatively short periods of time (hours/days/weeks). Select a time frame
to view data and continually updating data from new sensor measurements.
Multiple graphs can be created on one page that enables a dashboard to
be created of graphed sensor data. Each graph may have one or more
sensor measurement, output duration, or PID setpoint rendered onto it.
Several live graph options exist, such as the time period (x-axis) and
line colors, as well as navigation and data/image export options. To
edit graph options, select the plus sign on the top-right of a graph.

Asynchronous Graphs

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning
relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be
very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Live Graph. Select a
time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists.
The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every
view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700
data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be
created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables
much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4
months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded.
However, when viewing a 4 month span, it’s not possible to see every
data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is
inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what
you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only
~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which
time only another ~50kb is downloaded.

Note: Live Graphs require measurements to be acquired, therefore at
least one sensor needs to be added and activated in order to display
live data.


Camera

Once a cameras has been set up (in the Camera Settings), it may be used
to capture still images, create time-lapses, and stream video. Cameras
may also be used by Conditional Statements to trigger a camera image or
video capture (as well as the ability to email the image/video with a
notification).


Output Usage

Output usage statistics are calculated for each output, based on how
long the output has been powered, the current draw of the device
connected to the output, and other Relay Usage Settings.


System Backup

A backup is made to /var/Mycodo-backups when the system is upgraded
through the web interface or the upgrade script.


System Restore

If you need to restore a backup, do the following, changing the
appropriate directory names with these commands, changing ‘user’ to your
user name:

    sudo mv /home/user/Mycodo /home/user/Mycodo_old
    sudo cp -a /var/Mycodo-backups/Mycodo-TIME-COMMIT /home/user/Mycodo
    sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_post.sh



TROUBLESHOOTING


Daemon Not Running

-   Check the Logs: From the [Gear Icon] -> Mycodo Logs page, check the
    Daemon Log for any errors. If the issue began after an upgrade, also
    check the Upgrade Log for indications of an issue.
-   Determine if the Daemon is Running: Execute
    ps aux | grep '/var/www/mycodo/env/bin/python /var/www/mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py'
    in a terminal and look for an entry to be returned. If nothing is
    returned, the daemon is not running.
-   Daemon Lock File: If the daemon is not running, make sure the daemon
    lock file is deleted at /var/lock/mycodo.pid. The daemon cannot
    start if the lock file is present.
-   If a solution could not be found after investigating the above
    suggestions, submit a New Mycodo Issue on github.

INPUT AND DEVICE SETUP


Certain inputs will require extra steps to be taken in order to set up
the interface for communication. This includes I2C, one-wire, and UART.


Input Interfaces

Inputs are categorized below by their communication interface.

1-Wire

The 1-wire interface should be configured with these instructions.

  DS18B20: Temperature link (Also works with: DS18S20, DS1822, DS28EA00,
  DS1825/MAX31850K)

GPIO

  DHT11, DHT22/AM2302: Relative humidity and temperature link

  SHT1x/SHT7x, SHT2x: Relative humidity and temperature link

UART

  Atlas Scientific pH: pH link

  Atlas Scientific PT-1000: Temperature link

  K30: Carbon dioxide (CO2) in ppmv link

  MH-Z19: Carbon dioxide (CO2) in ppmv link

This documentation provides specific installation procedures for
configuring UART with the Raspberry Pi version 1 or 2.

The K30 may be tested by executing
~/Mycodo/mycodo/tests/manual_tests/test_uart_K30.py

For Atlas Scientific sensors, this guide may be used, as well as the
above K-30 guide, to set up UART on the Raspberry Pi 1 and 2. However,
for Pi 3s, use the procedure below.

Because the UART is handled differently by the Raspberry Pi 3, from of
the addition of bluetooth, there are a different set of instructions. If
installing Mycodo on a Raspberry Pi 3, you only need to perform these
steps to configure UART:

Run raspi-config

sudo raspi-config

Go to Advanced Options -> Serial and disable. Then edit /boot/config.txt

sudo vi /boot/config.txt

Find the line “enable_uart=0” and change it to “enable_uart=1”, then
reboot.

I2C

The I2C interface should be enabled with raspi-config.

ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTERS

An analog to digital converter (ADC) allows the use of any analog sensor
that outputs a variable voltage. A voltage divider may be necessary to
attain your desired range.

Edge Detection

The detection of a changing signal, for instance a simple switch
completing a circuit, requires the use of edge detection. By detecting a
rising edge (LOW to HIGH), a falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both,
actions or events can be triggered. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal
should be equipped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the
GPIO up [to 5-volts] or down [to ground]. The option to enable the
internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety
reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low.

Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple
switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect
sensors, float switches, and more.


Device Setup

I2C Multiplexers

All devices that connected to the Raspberry Pi by the I2C bus need to
have a unique address in order to communicate. Some inputs may have the
same address (such as the AM2315), which prevents more than one from
being connected at the same time. Others may provide the ability to
change the address, however the address range may be limited, which
limits by how many you can use at the same time. I2C multiplexers are
extremely clever and useful in these scenarios because they allow
multiple sensors with the same I2C address to be connected.

  TCA9548A: I2C Multiplexer link (I2C): Has 8 selectable addresses, so 8
  multiplexers can be connected to one Raspberry Pi. Each multiplexer
  has 8 channels, allowing up to 8 devices/sensors with the same address
  to be connected to each multiplexer. 8 multiplexers x 8 channels = 64
  devices/sensors with the same I2C address.

  TCA9545A: I2C Bus Multiplexer link (I2C): This board works a little
  differently than the TCA9548A, above. This board actually creates 4
  new I2C busses, each with their own selectable voltage, either 3.3 or
  5.0 volts. Instructions to enable the Device Tree Overlay are at
  https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a. Nothing else needs to be
  done in Mycodo after that except to select the correct I2C bus when
  configuring a sensor.
